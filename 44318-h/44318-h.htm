<p class="indent"><i>Lucius Cornelius Scipio the consul, having as lieutenant Publius Scipio
Africanus, (who had declared that he would be his brother&#8217;s lieutenant
if the province of Greece was decreed to him, when that province appeared
likely to be assigned to Caius L&aelig;lius, who had great influence in the senate,)
set out to wage war against Antiochus, and was the first Roman
general that ever passed over into Asia. &AElig;milius Regillus, with the
assistance of the Rhodians, fought successfully against the royal fleet of
Antiochus at Myonnesus. The son of Africanus, having been taken by
Antiochus, was sent back to his father. Manius Acilius Glabrio triumphed
over Antiochus, whom he had driven out of Greece, and over the
&AElig;tolians. Antiochus being subsequently conquered by Lucius Cornelius
Scipio, with the aid of Eumenes, son of Attalus, and king of Pergamus,
peace was granted to him on these terms&mdash;that he should evacuate all the
provinces on this side Mount Taurus. The kingdom of Eumenes, through
whose assistance Antiochus had been conquered, was enlarged. Some states
were granted to the Rhodians too, who also had assisted them. The
colony of Bononia was founded. &AElig;milius Regillus, who had conquered
the admirals of Antiochus in a naval engagement, triumphed. Lucius
Cornelius Scipio, who had brought the war with Antiochus to a conclusion,
was called Asiaticus, attaining to an equality with his brother by
this surname.</i></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a1" name="a1"></a>1</span>
Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Caius L&aelig;lius being consuls,
no business, after the duties of religion, was transacted
in the senate prior to that of the &AElig;tolians. Not only their ambassadors
were urgent, because they had a truce of a short
period, but they were aided by Titus Quinctius also, who had
then returned to Rome from Greece. The &AElig;tolians, as being
persons to whom there was more hope in the mercy of the
senate than in their cause, acted suppliantly, weighing their
by-gone services against their recent misconduct. But when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1656" id="Page_1656">Pg 1656</a></span>
present, they were importuned by questions of the senators,
wringing from them an acknowledgment of their guilt rather
than replies, and when ordered to depart from the senate, they
caused a great contest. Resentment had more power in their
case than compassion; for the senate were incensed against
them not merely as enemies, but as an uncivilized and unsocial
race. After it had been contested several days, it was at last
resolved, that peace should neither be granted nor refused.
Two conditions were offered them, either that they should yield
to the senate unconditional power over them, or pay one thousand
talents,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and have the same friends and enemies. To them,
desirous to elicit in what things they should give to the senate
unconditional power over them, no positive answer is given; but
being thus dismissed, without having concluded a peace, they
were ordered to quit the city that very day, and Italy within
fifteen days. They then began to debate concerning the provinces
for the consuls. Both of these wished for Greece. L&aelig;lius
had a powerful interest in the senate; and when the senate
had ordered that the consuls should either cast lots for the
provinces, or settle them between themselves, he observed,
that they would act with more propriety in leaving that matter
to the wisdom of the senators, than to the decision of lot.
To this Scipio, an answer being given that he would take
advice how he ought to act, having spoken to his brother alone,
and having been desired by him to leave it unhesitatingly
to the senate, answered his colleague that he would do what
he recommended. When this plan, either original or supported
by precedents of a record now lost by antiquity, being
referred to the senate, had aroused them by the expectation
of a contest, Publius Scipio Africanus said, that &#8220;if they decreed
that province to his brother, Lucius Scipio, he would
go along with him, as his lieutenant-general.&#8221; This proposal
being received with universal approbation, put an end to all
dispute. The senate were well pleased to make the trial,
whether king Antiochus should have more effectual aid in the
vanquished Hannibal, or the Roman consul and legions in his
conqueror Africanus; and they almost all voted Greece to
Scipio, and Italy to L&aelig;lius. The prætors then cast lots for
their provinces: Lucius Aurunculeius obtained the city jurisdiction;
Cneius Fulvius, the foreign; Lucius &AElig;milius Regillus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1657" id="Page_1657">Pg 1657</a></span>
the fleet; Publius Junius Brutus, the Tuscans; Marcus
Tuccius, Apulia and Bruttium; and Caius Atinius, Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a2" name="a2"></a>2</span>
Then to the consul to whom the province of Greece
had been decreed, in addition to the army which he was about
to receive from M. Acilius, (but they were two legions,) three
thousand Roman foot and one hundred horse, and of the
Latin confederates five thousand foot and two hundred horse,
are added as a reinforcement; and it was further ordered,
that if, when he arrived in his province, he would judge it
conducive to the public interest, he should be at liberty to
carry over the army into Asia. To the other consul was decreed
an army entirely new; two Roman legions, and of the
Latin confederates fifteen thousand foot and six hundred
horse. Quintius Minucius was ordered to remove his forces
out of Liguria (for he had written, that the province was
completely subdued, and that the whole nation of the Ligurians
had surrendered) into the country of the Boians, and
to give up the command to Publius Cornelius, proconsul. The
two city legions, enlisted the year before, about to be brought
home from the country in which Cornelius had fined the conquered
Boians, were assigned to Marcus Tuccius, pr&aelig;tor, together
with fifteen thousand foot and six hundred horse, of
the Latin confederates, to occupy Apulia and Bruttium. Orders
were given to Aulus Cornelius, a pr&aelig;tor of the preceding
year, who occupied Bruttium with an army, that if
the consul judged it proper, he should transport his legions
into. &AElig;tolia, and give them to Manius Acilius, provided the
latter was inclined to remain there; but if Acilius wished to
come to Rome, that then Aulus Cornelius should stay in
&AElig;tolia with that army. It was resolved that Caius Atinius
Labeo should receive from Marcus &AElig;milius the province of
Sicily, and the army there; and should, if he deemed it proper,
enlist in the province itself two thousand foot and one
hundred horse, for a reinforcement. Publius Junius Brutus
was ordered to raise a new army for Tuscany, consisting of
one Roman legion, and ten thousand foot of the allies and
Latin nation, and four hundred horse. Lucius &AElig;milius, whose
province was the sea, was ordered to receive from Marcus
Junius, pr&aelig;tor of the former year, twenty ships of war, with
their crews, and himself to enlist one thousand marines and
two thousand foot soldiers, with which ships and soldiers he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1658" id="Page_1658">[Pg 1658]</a></span>
was to sail to Asia, and receive the command of the fleet from
Caius Livius. To the governors of the two Spains and Sardinia,
their command is prolonged for a year, and the same
armies were decreed them. Sicily and Sardinia were, this
year, assessed in two-tenths of their corn. All the corn from
Sicily was ordered to be carried into &AElig;tolia, to the army
there; of that to be collected from Sardinia, one-half to Rome,
and the other half into &AElig;tolia, for the same use as the corn
from Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a3" name="a3"></a>3</span>
It was judged proper, that, previous to the departure of
the consuls for their provinces, the prodigies should be expiated
under the direction of the pontiffs. The temple of Juno
Lucina, at Rome, was struck by lightning in such a manner,
that the summit and the folding-doors were much damaged.
At Puteoli, the wall and a gate were struck by lightning in
several parts, and two men killed. It was clearly proved,
that, at Nursia, in the midst of a calm, a tempest suddenly
burst forth; and there also two freemen were killed.
The Tusculans reported, that a shower of earth fell in
their country; and the Reatines, that a mule brought forth,
young in theirs. These prodigies were expiated, and the
Latin festival was celebrated a second time, because the flesh-meat,
which ought to be given to the Laurentians, had not
been given them. There was also a supplication made on
account of those religious fears; the decemvirs gave directions
from the books, to which of the gods it should be performed.
Ten free-born youths, and ten virgins, all of whom
had their fathers and mothers living, were employed in that
ceremony; and the decemvirs sacrificed sucklings by night.
Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, before he left the city,
erected an arch on the Capitol, facing the road by which we
ascend to it, with seven gilded statues and two horses, and
placed two marble cisterns in the front of the arch. During
that period, forty-three of the principal &AElig;tolians, among
whom were Damocritus and his brother, were brought to Rome
by two cohorts, sent by Manius Acilius, and were thrown into
the prison called Lautumi&aelig;, or the quarry. Lucius Cornelius
the consul ordered the cohorts after that to return to the army.
Ambassadors came from Ptolemy and Cleopatra, king and
queen of Egypt, congratulating the Romans because the consul
Manius Acilius had driven king Antiochus out of Greece,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1659" id="Page_1659">Pg 1659</a></span>
and advising that they should carry over their army into Asia.
For &#8220;all places, not only in Asia, but also in Syria, were
filled with consternation; and the king and queen of Egypt
would be prepared to do those things which the senate should
direct.&#8221; Thanks were returned to the king and queen, and
presents were ordered to be made to the ambassadors, four
thousand <i>asses</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> to each.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a4" name="a4"></a>4</span>
The consul Lucius Cornelius, having finished what was
necessary to be done at Rome, gave public notice, in an assembly
of the people, that the soldiers, whom he himself had
enlisted for a reinforcement, and those who were in Bruttiurn
with Aulus Cornelius, propr&aelig;tor, should all meet him at
Brundusium on the ides of July. He likewise appointed
three lieutenants-general, Sextus Digitius, Lucius Apustius,
and Caius Fabricius Luscinus; who were to bring together
ships from all parts of the sea-coast to Brundusium; and now,
every thing being ready, he set out from the city in his military
robe of state. About five thousand volunteers of the
Romans and allies, who had served out their campaigns, under
the command of Publius Africanus, attended the consul at his
departure, and gave in their names. At the time in which the
consul set out to the war during the celebration of the Apollinarian
games, on the fifth day before the ides of July, though
the sky was serene, the light was obscured in the middle of
the day, when the moon passed beneath the orb of the sun.
L. &AElig;milius Regillus, to whom the sea had fallen as his
province, set out at the same time. To Lucius Aurunculeius
this business was assigned by the senate, that he
should build thirty quinqueremes and twenty triremes, because
there was a report that Antiochus, since the engagement
at sea, was fitting out a much larger fleet. The &AElig;tolians,
after the ambassadors brought back word from Rome that
there was no hope of peace, although their whole sea-coast,
which was opposite to Peloponnesus, was ravaged
by the Ach&aelig;ans, regarding the danger more than their
losses, seized on Mount Corax, in order to shut up the pass
against the Romans; for they had no doubt that they would
return in the beginning of spring to the siege of Naupactum.
It appeared better to Acilius, who knew that this was expected,
to attempt a thing that was not anticipated, and to lay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1660" id="Page_1660">Pg 1660</a></span>
siege to Lamia; for the garrison had been reduced by Philip
almost to a state of desperation; and being then off their guard,
because they feared no such attempt, might be surprised by
himself. Marching from Elatia, he formed his first encampment
in the enemy&#8217;s country, on the banks of the river Sperchius,
and decamping thence in the night, he at break of day
attacked the town with a line of troops that encircled it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a5" name="a5"></a>5</span>
As is usual in an unexpected affair, great consternation
and tumult ensued; yet the besieged, with greater resolution
than any one could suppose them capable of under such a sudden
alarm, when the men fought, and the women brought
weapons of every kind, and stones, to the walls, defended the
city for that day, although the scaling ladders were raised
against the walls. About mid-day, Acilius, the signal for retreat
being given, drew off his men to their camp. After their
bodies were refreshed by food and rest, before he dismissed
the meeting in the Pr&aelig;torium, he gave them notice, &#8220;to be
ready and under arms before day; and that they were not to
return to their tents until the city should be taken.&#8221; Next
day, at the same hour as before, having began the assault in
a greater number of places, as not only the strength, but also
the weapons, and above all, the courage of the garrison began
to fail, he took the town in the space of a few hours. One
half of the spoil found there was sold in parcels; the other was
divided among the soldiers; and a council was held to determine
what he should next undertake. No one approved of
going against Naupactum, while the pass at Corax was occupied
by the &AElig;tolians. That, however, the summer campaign
might not be an idle one, and that the &AElig;tolians might
not through his supineness possess the peace that they
could not obtain from the senate, Acilius resolved to besiege
Amphissa; his army was led thither from Heraclea by &#338;ta.
Having encamped under the walls, he proceeded to attack the
town, not by general assault, as at Lamia, but by regular approaches.
The ram was brought up to the walls in many
places at once; and though these were shaken by it, yet the
townsmen never attempted to provide or contrive any sort of
defence against such a description of mechanism. All their
hope was in arms and courage. By frequent sallies they much
annoyed not only the advanced guards of the Romans, but
even those who were employed at the works and machines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1661" id="Page_1661">Pg 1661</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a6" name="a6"></a>6</span>
However, the wall was broken down in many places,
when word was brought, that his successor, having landed his
army at Apollonia, was coming through Epirus and Thessaly.
The consul came with thirteen thousand foot and five hundred
horse. He had already arrived at the Malian bay; and after
that, to his messengers sent forward to Hypata, to order a surrender
of the city, this response was given, that they would do
nothing except by the common consent of the &AElig;tolians: that the
siege of Hypata might not detain him while Amphissa was not
yet recovered, having sent forward his brother Africanus, he
leads his forces to Amphissa. A little before their arrival, the
towns-people having abandoned the city, for it was now, for the
most part, stripped of its walls; all, armed and unarmed, retired
into the citadel, which they deemed an impregnable fortress.
The consul pitched his camp at the distance of about six
miles from the town; and thither came ambassadors from the
Athenians, addressing, first, Publius Scipio, who preceded
the main body as before mentioned, and afterwards the consul,
with earnest supplications in favour of the &AElig;tolians. They
received a milder answer from Africanus, who, wishing for an
honourable pretext for relinquishing the &AElig;tolian war, was
directing his views towards Asia and king Antiochus, and had
recommended to the Athenians to persuade, not only the Romans,
but the &AElig;tolians likewise, to prefer peace to war. By
the advice of the Athenians a numerous embassy of the &AElig;tolians
came speedily from Hypata, and the discourse of Africanus,
whom they addressed first, augmented their hopes of
peace; for he mentioned, that &#8220;many nations and states, first
in Spain, and afterwards in Africa, had thrown themselves on
his protection; and that, in all of them, he had left greater
monuments of clemency and kindness than of military prowess.&#8221;
The business seemed to be concluded, when the consul,
on being applied to, repeated the very same answer with
which they had been driven off by the senate. When the
&AElig;tolians were thunderstruck at this, as if they had never
heard it before, (for they now perceived that no progress was
made either from the Athenian embassy or the favourable
reply of Africanus,) they said that they wished to consult their
countrymen on the affair.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a7" name="a7"></a>7</span>
They then returned to Hypata, nor were their plans cleared
of difficulties. For they had no means of paying the thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1662" id="Page_1662">Pg 1662</a></span>
talents; and, in case of an unconditional submission, they
dreaded lest cruelty should be inflicted on their persons.
They, therefore, ordered the same ambassadors to return to
the consul and Africanus, and to request, that if they meant
in reality to grant them peace, and not merely to amuse them
with a prospect of it, frustrating the hopes of the wretched,
they would either remit some part of the money required to
be paid, or order that the unconditional submission should
not extend to their persons. Nothing was accomplished whereby
the consul might change his resolution; and that embassy,
also, was dismissed without effect. The Athenian ambassadors
accompanied them. And Echedemus, their principal in the
embassy, recalled to hope the &AElig;tolians, dejected by so
many repulses, and deploring with unavailing lamentations
the hard fate of their nation&mdash;by advising them to request a
suspension of arms for six months, in order that they might
send an embassy to Rome. He urged that &#8220;the delay could
add nothing to their present calamities, which were already
severe in the extreme; but that, if time intervened, their
present calamities might be alleviated by many chances.
Agreeably to this advice of Echedemus, the same ambassadors
were sent again; who, making their first application to Publius
Scipio, obtained, through him, from the consul, a suspension
of arms for the time they desired: and the siege of Amphissa
being raised, Manius Acilius, the army being delivered
to the consul, left the province; and the consul returned from
Amphissa into Thessaly, with intention of leading his troops
into Asia through Macedonia and Thrace. Here Africanus
said to his brother, Lucius Scipio, &#8220;I also, Lucius Scipio, approve
of the route which you adopt. But the whole matter
rests on the inclinations of Philip; for if he be faithful to our
government, he will afford us a passage, and provisions and
all things which support and aid an army on a long march.
But if he should fail in this, you will find no safety in any
part of Thrace. In my opinion, therefore, the king&#8217;s disposition
ought in the first place to be discovered. He will be best
tested if the person who shall be sent will come suddenly
upon him, doing nothing by a preconcerted plan.&#8221; Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus, a young man, the most active of all
the youths at that time, being selected for this purpose, by
means of relays of horses, and travelling with almost incredible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1663" id="Page_1663">Pg 1663</a></span>
expedition, made good the journey from Amphissa, whence
he had been despatched, to Pella, on the third day. The king
was sitting at a banquet, and was far gone in his cups: that very
relaxation of mind removed all suspicion of any intention of
changing his measures. His guest was kindly entertained
for the present; and next day he saw provisions in abundance
already prepared for the army, bridges made over rivers,
and roads fortified where the passage was difficult. As he was
bringing back this intelligence, with the same speed which
he had used in coming, he met the consul at Thaumaci. From
this the army rejoicing, marched with more certain and greater
hopes into Macedon, where all things were prepared. On their
arrival, the king received them with royal magnificence, and
accompanied them on their march. Much pleasantry and
good humour appeared in him, which recommended him much
to Africanus, a man who, as he was unparalleled in other
respects, was not averse to courteousness unaccompanied by
luxury. Passing from this not only through Macedon, but
also through Thrace, they arrived at the Hellespont, Philip
escorting them and making every preparation.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a8" name="a8"></a>8</span>
Antiochus, after the sea-fight at Corycus, when he had
the whole winter disengaged to carry on his preparations by
land and water, was chiefly intent on the refitting of his ships,
lest he should be entirely excluded from the sea. It occurred
to him that he had been defeated when the Rhodian fleet was
absent; if this fleet were present in an engagement, (and the
Rhodians would certainly not be guilty of being late a second
time,) he required a vast number of ships to equal the
fleet of the enemy, in the strength of their crews and
size of their vessels. For this reason, he sent Hannibal
into Syria, to bring in the Ph&#339;nician navy, and gave orders
to Polyxenidas, that, the more unsuccessfully affairs had been
managed before, the more diligently he should now repair the
ships which he had, and procure others. He himself passed
the winter in Phrygia, calling in auxiliaries from every
quarter. He had even sent for that purpose to Gallogr&aelig;cia.
The people of that country were then more warlike than at
present, retaining the Gallic spirit, as the generation which
had emigrated thither was not yet extinct. He had left his
son Seleucus with an army in &AElig;olia, to keep in obedience the
maritime cities, which on one side Eumenes from Pergamus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1664" id="Page_1664">Pg 1664</a></span>
on the other, the Romans from Phoc&aelig;a and Erythr&aelig;,
were soliciting to revolt. The Roman fleet, as mentioned
before, wintered at Can&aelig;; thither, about the middle of the
season, came king Eumenes, with two thousand foot and one
hundred horse. He, when he affirmed that vast quantities of
spoil might be brought off from the enemy&#8217;s country round
Thyatira; by his persuasions, prevailed on Livius to send
with him five thousand soldiers. Those that were sent within
a few days carried off an immense booty.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a9" name="a9"></a>9</span>
Meanwhile a sedition broke out at Phoc&aelig;a, in consequence
of some endeavouring to bring over the multitude to
the party of Antiochus. The winter quarters of the ships
were burdensome: the tribute was burdensome, because five
hundred gowns with five hundred tunics were exacted from
them: the scarcity of corn was also galling, on account of
which the ships also and garrison of Rome evacuated the
place. The faction which laboured in their assemblies to
draw the commonalty over to Antiochus, was now freed from
all apprehension: the senate, and higher ranks, were of
opinion that they should persevere in the alliance with Rome.
But the advisers of a revolt had greater influence with the
multitude. The Rhodians, the earlier in proportion to their
having been too late in the former summer, sent in the vernal
equinox, as commander of their fleet, with thirty-six ships, the
same Pausistratus. At this time Livius, with thirty ships and
seven quadriremes, which king Eumenes had brought with
him, was on his passage from Can&aelig; to the Hellespont, in
order to prepare every thing necessary for the transportation
of the army, which he expected to come by land. He first
brought his fleet into the harbour called the Ach&aelig;an; whence
he went up to Ilium, and having offered sacrifice to Minerva,
gave a kind reception to the embassies from the states in the
neighbourhood, from El&aelig;us, Dardanum, and Rhet&aelig;um, surrendering
their respective states to him. Then he sailed to
the entrance of the Hellespont; and, leaving ten ships stationed
opposite to Abydos, he crossed over to Europe with
the rest of the fleet, to attack Sestos. As the troops were
advancing up to the walls, first of all inspired priests of
Cybele,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> in their solemn dress, met them before the gate.
These said, that, &#8220;by order of the mother of the gods, they,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1665" id="Page_1665">Pg 1665</a></span>
the immediate servants of the goddess, were come to pray the
Roman commander to spare the walls and the city.&#8221; None of
them was injured; and, presently, the whole senate and the
magistrates came out to surrender the place. The fleet then
sailed over to Abydos; where when, their minds being
sounded by conferences, no peaceable answer was given, they
prepared themselves for a siege.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a10" name="a10"></a>10</span>
While these transactions are carried on at the Hellespont,
Polyxenidas, the commander of the king&#8217;s fleet, (but he was
an exile from Rhodes,) having heard that the ships of his countrymen
had sailed from home, and that Pausistratus, who commanded
them, had, in a public speech, uttered several haughty
and contemptuous expressions respecting him, and having
conceived a particular jealousy against him, considered nothing
else, night or day, than that by his acts he should refute his
boastful words. He sent a person, who was known to him,
to say, that &#8220;if it were allowed, he would be of great service
to Pausistratus, and to his native country; and that he might
be restored by Pausistratus to his country.&#8221; When Pausistratus,
in surprise, asked by what means such things could be
effected; and pledged his faith to the other, at his request,
that he would either concur in the execution of the design, or
bury it in silence; the emissary then told him, that &#8220;Polyxenidas
would deliver into his hands, either the whole of the
king&#8217;s fleet or the greater part of it; and as a reward, he
stipulated for nothing more, than a return to his native
country.&#8221; The importance of the business had this effect,
that he neither believed nor despised his proposition. He sailed
to Panormus, in the Samian territory, and stopped there in
order to examine thoroughly the business which was proposed
to him. Messengers passed rapidly from both parties, nor
was confidence inspired into Pausistratus until, in the presence
of his messenger, Polyxenidas wrote, with his own hand, an
engagement that he would perform all that he had promised,
and sent the tablets sealed with his own seal. By such a
pledge as this, he thought that the traitor was completely
engaged to him. For, &#8220;that he who lived under a king
would never act so absurdly as to give evidence of guilt against
himself, attested by his own signature.&#8221; The method of conducting
the pretended plot was then settled: Polyxenidas
said that &#8220;he would neglect every kind of preparation; that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1666" id="Page_1666">Pg 1666</a></span>
he would not keep any considerable numbers on board, either
of rowers or mariners; that he would haul up on land some
of the ships, under pretence of refitting them; would send
away others into the neighbouring ports, and keep a few at
sea before the harbour of Ephesus; which, if circumstances
made it necessary to come out, he would expose to a battle.&#8221;
The negligence which Pausistratus heard that Polyxenidas was
about to use in his fleet, he himself immediately practised. Part
of his ships he sent to Halicarnassus to bring provisions, another
part to the city of Samos, while he himself waited at Panormus,
that he might be ready when he should receive the
signal of attack from the traitor. Polyxenidas encouraged
his mistake by counterfeiting neglect; hauled up some ships,
and, as if he intended to haul up others, put the docks in
repair; he did not call the rowers from their winter quarters
to Ephesus, but assembled them secretly at Magnesia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a11" name="a11"></a>11</span>
By chance one of Antiochus&#8217;s soldiers, when he had
come to Samos on account of private business, being seized
as a spy, is brought to Panormus to the admiral. This man,
it is uncertain whether through fear or treachery towards his
countrymen, disclosed all things to him, inquiring what was
going on at Ephesus: that the fleet lay in harbour, fully
equipped and ready for sea; that all the rowers had been sent
to Magnesia (at Sipylus); that very few of the ships had
been hauled on land; that the docks were shut, and that
never was the business of the fleet conducted with greater
diligence. But the mind of Pausistratus, prepossessed by
misplaced confidence and vain hopes, caused these things
not to be attended to as true. Polyxenidas, having fully
adjusted all his measures, having called in the rowers from
Magnesia, and launched hastily the ships that were in dock,
by night, after wasting the day not so much in preparation as
because he was unwilling that the fleet should be seen going
to sea, set sail after sun-set with seventy decked ships, and,
the wind being contrary, put into the harbour of Pygelia
before daylight. Where when he had rested during the day,
for the same reason as before, he passed over, in the night to
the nearest part of the Samian territory. From this place,
having ordered a certain Nicander, a chief pirate, to sail with
five decked ships to Palinurus, and thence to lead his armed
men by the shortest road through the fields towards Panormus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1667" id="Page_1667">Pg 1667</a></span>
and so to come behind the enemy; he himself, in the
mean time, with his fleet in two divisions, in order that it might
command the mouth of the harbour on both sides, proceeded
to Panormus. Pausistratus was at first confused for a little, as
the thing was unexpected; but afterwards, being an old soldier,
having quickly regained his courage, and judging that the
enemy would be more easily repelled by land than by sea, he
marched his armed forces in two bodies to the promontories,
which, by their heads projecting into the deep, formed the
harbour; under the impression that he could easily repel the
enemy by weapons on both sides, from the two promontories.
When the sight of Nicander on the land had disconcerted this
undertaking, having suddenly changed his design, he ordered
all to go on board the ships. Then truly a great confusion
arose among soldiers and sailors alike, and a sort of flight to
the ships took place, when they perceived themselves surrounded
by land and sea at the same time. Pausistratus
supposed that the only way of safety was to force through
the narrow entrance of the port, and push out into the open
sea; and after that he saw his men embarked, ordering
the rest to follow, he himself the first, with ship urged
vigorously by the oars, pressed to the mouth of the harbour.
Just as his ship was clearing the entrance, Polyxenidas, with
three quinqueremes, surrounded it. The vessel, shattered by
their beaks, sunk; the crew were overwhelmed with weapons,
and, among them, Pausistratus, fighting gallantly, was slain.
Of the rest of the ships, some were taken outside of the harbour,
some within, and others by Nicander, while they were
putting off from the shore. Only five Rhodian and two Coan
ships effected an escape, a passage being made for them
through the thick of the enemy, by the terror of shining
flames; for they carried before them, on two poles projecting
from their prows, a great quantity of fire contained in iron
vessels. The galleys of Erythr&aelig;, after meeting not far from
Samos the Rhodian ships, then flying, which they were coming
to succour, bore away to the Romans in the direction of the
Hellespont. About the same time, Seleucus got possession of
Phoc&aelig;a by treachery, one gate being opened by the sentinels.
Cyme, with the other cities on that coast, revolted to him
through fear.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a12" name="a12"></a>12</span>
Whilst these events are taking place in &AElig;olis, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1668" id="Page_1668">Pg 1668</a></span>
Abydos, which was defended by a garrison of the king&#8217;s troops,
had sustained a siege of several days, all parties then grew
weary of the struggle, and the magistrates, with the permission
of Philotas, the commander of the garrison, began to treat
with Livius, concerning the terms on which they should surrender
the city. Because they could not agree whether the
king&#8217;s troops should march out with their arms, or without them,
this question protracted the matter. When the intelligence of
the destruction of the Rhodians interrupted them, treating of
these things, the matter was dropped. For Livius, fearing lest
Polyxenidas, elated by his recent success in such an important
enterprise, might surprise the fleet which lay at Can&aelig;, instantly
abandoned the siege of Abydos and the guard of the Hellespont,
and drew out the ships that were in dock at Can&aelig;, and
Eumenes came to El&aelig;a. Livius, with the whole fleet, to which
he had joined two triremes of Mitylene, sailed to Phoc&aelig;a; but,
having learned that this place was held, by a strong garrison of
the king&#8217;s troops, and that the camp of Seleucus was not far
distant, he ravaged the sea-coast, hastily conveying on board
the booty, which consisted chiefly of men, and waiting only until
Eumenes, with his fleet, came up, he endeavours to reach Samos.
Among the Rhodians, the news of their misfortune excited,
at first, both consternation, and the greatest grief, at the
same time. For, besides the loss of their ships and soldiers,
they had lost the flower and strength of their youth; many
young men of distinction having been induced, among other
motives, by the character of Pausistratus, which was deservedly
very high among his countrymen. Afterwards, because they
had been circumvented by treachery, and by a countryman of
their own, above all men, their grief was changed into anger.
They sent out ten ships immediately, and, in a few days, ten
more, Eudamus being commander of all; who, though far
inferior to Pausistratus in warlike qualifications, they supposed
would be a more cautious leader, as he was not of so
high a spirit. The Romans, and king Eumenes, put in their
fleet, first, at Erythr&aelig;; and, having staid there one night, they,
on next day, reached Corycus, a promontory in Teios. When
they intended to pass over hence, to the nearest part of the
Samian territory; not waiting for the rising of the sun, from
which the pilots could learn the state of the weather, they
exposed themselves to the varying storm. About the middle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1669" id="Page_1669">Pg 1669</a></span>
of the passage, the wind changing from north-east to north,
they began to be tossed about on the sea, stormy with
billows.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a13" name="a13"></a>13</span>
Polyxenidas, taking it for granted that the enemy would
go to Samos to join the Rhodian fleet, set sail from Ephesus,
and stopped first at Myonnesus, from whence he crossed over
to the island which they call Macris; in order that, when the
enemy&#8217;s fleet should sail by, he might be able to attack, with
advantage, either any ships that straggled from the main
body, or might attack the rear of the fleet itself. After that
he saw the fleet dispersed by the storm, first of all he thought
this a good opportunity to attack it; but, in a little time, the
wind increasing and raising a heavy sea, because he could
not possibly come up with them, he steered to the island
of &AElig;thalia, that, from thence, he might next day fall on the
ships, as they made for Samos, from the main sea. A small
number of Roman vessels, just as it grew dark, got into a
desert harbour on the Samian coast; the rest, after being
tossed about all night, ran into the same harbour. Then when
it was learned from the country people, that the enemy&#8217;s fleet
lay at &AElig;thalia, a consultation was held whether they should
attack them immediately, or wait for that of the Rhodian fleet.
The attack being deferred, for so they resolved, they sailed
away to Corycus, whence they had come. Polyxenidas also,
having kept his station for some time, without effecting any
thing, returned to Ephesus. On this the Roman ships, the
sea being clear of the enemy, sailed to Samos. The Rhodian
fleet came to the same place after a few days. And that it
might appear that they were only waiting for this, they immediately
sailed away to Ephesus, that they should either
decide it in a naval contest, or, in case the enemy should
decline a battle, to extort from them a confession of fear,
which would have the best effect on the minds of the states
of Asia. They lay opposite the entrance of the harbour, with
the fleet formed in a line abreast of it, but none came out
against them; the fleet being divided, one part lay at anchor
before the mouth of the harbour, the other landed a body of
soldiers. Andronicus, a Macedonian, who was in garrison
at Ephesus, then made a sally against them, driving off great
booty from the widely-deserted country; when they came
near the walls, he stripped them of the greatest part of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1670" id="Page_1670">Pg 1670</a></span>
plunder, and drove them down to the shore and their ships.
On the day following, the Romans, having laid an ambuscade
about the middle of the way, marched in a body to the city,
in order to entice the Macedonians out of the gates. Then,
when that same fear had deterred any one from coming out, the
Romans returned to their ships. And the enemy avoiding a
contest by land or sea, the fleet sailed back to Samos, whence
it came. The pr&aelig;tor then detached two Rhodian triremes,
and two belonging to the Italian allies, under the command of
Epicrates, a Rhodian, to guard the strait of Cephallenia.
Hybristas, a Laced&aelig;monian, at the head of a band of young
Cephallenians, infested it with piracies; and the passage was
shut against the convoys from Italy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a14" name="a14"></a>14</span>
Epicrates met, at Pir&aelig;us, Lucius &AElig;milius Regillus,
who was on his way to take the command of the fleet. On
hearing of the defeat of the Rhodians, as he had only two
quinqueremes, he carried back with him to Asia Epicrates
and his four ships. Some undecked vessels of the Athenians
followed him. He crossed the &AElig;gean Sea to Chios. To
which place came, in the middle of the night, Timasicrates,
a Rhodian, with two quadriremes from Samos, and, being presented
to &AElig;milius, he told him that he was despatched for the
purpose of convoying him in safety, because the king&#8217;s ships,
by frequent excursions from the Hellespont and Abydos, rendered
the sea on that coast dangerous to transports. Two
Rhodian quadriremes met &AElig;milius on his passage from Chios
to Samos, being sent by Livius to attend him, and king Eumenes
with two quinqueremes met him. &AElig;milius, after he
arrived at Samos, as soon as he had received the command of
the fleet from Livius, and duly performed the usual sacrifices,
called a council. Here, Caius Livius, whose opinion was first
asked, said, that &#8220;no one could give advice with more sincerity
than he, who recommended to another what himself
would do in the same case. That he had intended to sail with
the whole fleet to Ephesus; to take with him ships of burden,
heavily laden with ballast, and to sink them in the entrance
of the harbour. That the narrow passage might be shut up
with less difficulty on this account, because the mouth of the
port was like a river, long and narrow, and full of shoals. By
this expedient he was about to cut off the enemy&#8217;s communication
with the sea, and render their fleet useless.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1671" id="Page_1671">Pg 1671</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a15" name="a15"></a>15</span>
This plan was not approved by any of the council.
King Eumenes asked, &#8220;What then? when, by sinking the
ships, they should have barred the pass to the sea, their own
fleet being at liberty, would they depart from the place to bear
aid to the allies, and strike terror into their enemies? or whether,
with no less ardour, they would block up the port with their
whole force? For, if they should withdraw, who could doubt
that the enemy would weigh up the masses that were sunk,
and open the port with less labour than it had cost to shut it?
But if, after all, they were to remain there, what advantage
would accrue from the harbour being closed? Nay, on the
contrary, the enemy enjoying a safe haven, and an opulent
city, furnished, at the same time, with every thing from Asia,
would pass the summer at their ease, while the Romans, exposed
in the open sea to winds and waves, and in want of every
accommodation, must continue on guard, without intermission;
and would be themselves tied down, and hindered from doing
any thing that ought to be done, rather than to keep the enemy
shut up.&#8221; Eudamus, commander of the Rhodian fleet, rather
showed his disapprobation of the plan proposed, than proposed
himself what he thought should be done. Epicrates, the
Rhodian, advised, &#8220;not to think of Ephesus for the present,
but that a part of the fleet should be sent to Lycia, and that
Patara, the metropolis of that nation, should be brought into
a treaty of alliance. This would conduce to two important
purposes: first, the Rhodians, owing to peace being established
in the countries opposite to their island, could apply the whole
of their strength to the care of the war against Antiochus;
and then the fleet which the enemy were fitting out in Lycia,
would be blocked up, and prevented from joining Polyxenidas.&#8221;
This plan influenced the most. Nevertheless, it was determined
that Regillus should sail, with the entire fleet, to the
harbour of Ephesus, to strike terror into the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a16" name="a16"></a>16</span>
Caius Livius was sent to Lycia, with two Roman quinqueremes,
four Rhodian quadriremes, and two open vessels of
Smyrna; being ordered to proceed, first, to Rhodes, and to
communicate all his designs to the government there. The
states which he passed in his way, Miletus, Myndus, Halicarnassus,
Cnidus, and Cous, diligently executed his orders.
When he came to Rhodes, he explained, to the persons in authority,
the business on which he was sent, and, at the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1672" id="Page_1672">Pg 1672</a></span>
time, desired their opinion. All approving his design, and
three quadriremes being added to that fleet which he had, he
set sail for Patara. The wind being favourable at first, carried
them very near the city, and they were in hopes of effecting
something by surprise. After that, the wind veering, the sea
had begun to roll in heavy waves, they persevered at their oars
until they reached the land; but there was no safe anchorage
there, nor could they ride in the road, as the sea was rough,
and night was coming on. They, therefore, sailed past the
city, to the port of Ph&#339;nicus, which was not quite two miles
distant, and which afforded shelter from the violence of the
waves, but high cliffs overlooked it, which the towns-people,
joined by the king&#8217;s troops which were in garrison, immediately
seized. Livius, though the landing-places were rugged
and difficult, sent against them a party of the auxiliaries,
composed of Iss&aelig;ans, and light infantry of Smyrna. These
(whilst they were skirmishing with missile weapons, and in
slight attacks on the few who were there at first, rather
than engaging in battle) supported the contest sufficiently
well. After that greater numbers flocked thither from the
city, and at length, the whole multitude pouring out, fear
seized Livius, not only that the auxiliaries might be cut
off, but that the ships would be in danger from the land.
In consequence he led out to the engagement, not only the
soldiers, but the marines, and even the crowd of rowers, armed
with such weapons as each could find. After all, however,
the fight was doubtful; and, besides a considerable number
of soldiers, Lucius Apustius fell in this disorderly combat.
At last, the Lycians were routed, and driven within their
gates; and the Romans, with a bloody victory, returned to
their ships. They then proceeded to the gulf of Telmissus,
which washes Caria on one side, and Lycia on the other,
where all thoughts of any further attempt on Patara were
laid aside, the Rhodians were sent home, and Livius, sailing
along the coast of Asia, crossed over to Greece, that he might
have a meeting with the Scipios, who were at that time in
Thessaly, and then take his passage to Italy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a17" name="a17"></a>17</span>
&AElig;milius, although he himself had been driven off from
Ephesus by a storm, and had returned to Samos without effecting
any thing, after he knew that the expedition to Lycia
was dropped, and that Livius had gone to Italy, having thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1673" id="Page_1673">Pg 1673</a></span>
it disgraceful that Patara should be attacked in vain, resolved
to go thither and attack the city with his utmost force.
Having sailed past Miletus, and the rest of the coast of the
allies, he made a descent in the bay of Bargyll&aelig;, with the
design of reducing Jassus. A garrison of the king&#8217;s troops
held the city, and the Romans made hostile depredations on
all the country round. He then sent persons to confer with
the magistrates and principal inhabitants, and sound their
dispositions. After they answered that nothing was in their
power, he advanced to lay siege to the city. There were, with
the Romans, some exiles from Jassus, who, in a body, earnestly
importuned the Rhodians &#8220;not to suffer an unoffending city,
which was as well a neighbouring one as also connected with
them in consanguinity, to be ruined. They themselves were
banished for no other cause than their faithful attachment to
the Romans; and those who remained in the place were held
in subjection by the same force by which they had been expelled.
The wish of the people of Jassus was one, to escape
from a state of slavery under the king.&#8221; The Rhodians,
moved by their entreaties, and calling in the assistance of
king Eumenes, by representing, at the same time, their own
connexions with them, and also the unfortunate condition of
the city, which was kept in bondage by the king&#8217;s garrison,
prevailed on &AElig;milius to drop the siege. Departing hence,
and coasting along the shore of Asia, the other places being
at peace, they arrived at Loryma, a port opposite to Rhodes.
Here, at head-quarters, a private conversation arises first
among the tribunes of the soldiers, and afterwards reached the
ears of &AElig;milius, that the fleet was going off to a distance
from Ephesus, from the war which concerned themselves; so
that the enemy, being left behind, without control, might
safely make whatever attempts they pleased against so many
states of the allies, in their neighbourhood. These remarks
moved &AElig;milius; and calling the Rhodians to him, he asked
them, whether the whole fleet could lie in the harbour of
Patara: when they answered that it could not, furnished
with an excuse for laying aside the design, he sailed back to
Samos.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a18" name="a18"></a>18</span>
In the mean time Seleucus, son of Antiochus, who had
kept his army in &AElig;tolia, through the whole of the winter employed,
partly, in succouring his allies, partly, in ravaging the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1674" id="Page_1674">Pg 1674</a></span>
lands of those whom he could not seduce to his side, resolved to
make an incursion on the territory of king Eumenes, while he,
at a great distance from home, was assisting the Romans and
Rhodians, in attacks on the maritime parts of Lycia. He advanced
with hostile standards, first, to El&aelig;a; afterwards, the design
of besieging it being given up, having wasted the country
in a hostile manner, he led his army to lay siege to Pergamus,
the capital and principal fortress of the kingdom. Attalus, at
first, posting advanced guards outside the city, and sending
out parties of cavalry and light infantry, harassed rather
than withstood the enemy. But, after some time, having discovered,
in slight skirmishes, that he was not a match for the
enemy in any respect, he drew back his men within the fortifications,
and then the city began to be besieged. About
this time, Antiochus, leaving Apamea with a vast army compounded
of various nations, encamped first at Sardis, and
afterwards took post at a small distance from the camp of
Seleucus, at the head of the river Caicus. The most formidable
part of his force was a body of four thousand Gauls,
procured for hire: these, with a few others intermixed, he
detached, with orders to waste utterly the country about Pergamus.
When news of these transactions arrived at Samos,
Eumenes being thus recalled by a war in his own dominions,
sailed with his fleet to El&aelig;a; and finding there, in readiness,
some light troops of horse and foot, he took them for an escort,
and proceeded directly to Pergamus, before the enemy
could be apprized of his arrival, or could put themselves in
motion. Then again skirmishes began to take place in the
sallies, Eumenes undoubtedly shrinking from the risk of a
decisive engagement. In a few days after the combined fleet
of the Romans and Rhodians came from Samos to El&aelig;a, to
support the king. When information was brought to Antiochus
that these had landed troops at El&aelig;a, and that so many
fleets were assembled in one harbour, and at the same time
heard that the consul, with his army, was already in Macedonia,
and that the things that were necessary for the passage
of the Hellespont were being prepared, he judged that now
was the time for negotiation, before he should be pressed on
sea and land at once; and with this view he chose for his
camp a rising ground opposite to El&aelig;a. Leaving there all
the infantry, with his cavalry, amounting to six thousand, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1675" id="Page_1675">Pg 1675</a></span>
went down into the plains, which lay under the walls of the
town, having despatched a herald to &AElig;milius, to acquaint
him that he wished to treat of peace.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a19" name="a19"></a>19</span>
&AElig;milius sent to Pergamus for Eumenes, and desiring
the Rhodians to be present, held a council on the message.
The Rhodians were not averse to a pacification; but Eumenes
affirmed that &#8220;it was not honourable to treat of peace
at that time, nor could an end be put to the thing.&#8221; &#8220;For,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;how can we, shut up as we are, within our walls, and
besieged, with honour accept terms of peace? Or to whom
shall that treaty be valid, which we shall conclude, without
the presence of the consul, without a vote of the senate, and
without an order of the Roman people? For, let me ask,
supposing the matter concluded by you, would you immediately
go home to Italy, and carry away your fleet and army,
or would you wait to know the consul&#8217;s determination on the
case; what the senate should decree, or the people order?
It remains therefore that you must stay in Asia, that your
troops being led back again into winter quarters, the war being
given over, must exhaust the allies in furnishing provisions;
and then, if it seem fit to those who have the power of determining,
we must begin the whole war anew, which we are
able, with the aid of the gods, to finish before winter, if no
relaxation from our present vigorous movements is made by
delay.&#8221; This opinion prevailed; and the answer given to
Antiochus was, that they could not treat of peace before the
arrival of the consul. Antiochus, peace being tried for in
vain, ravaged, first, the territory of El&aelig;a, then that of
Pergamus; and, leaving there his son Seleucus, marched in a
hostile manner to Adramyttium, whence he proceeded to a
rich tract of country called the Plain of Thebes, a city
celebrated in one of Homer&#8217;s poems; and in no other place
in Asia did the king&#8217;s soldiers find such a plenty of booty.
At the same time, &AElig;milius and Eumenes also, sailing round
with the fleet, came to Adramyttium, to protect the city.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a20" name="a20"></a>20</span>
By chance, at this time, one thousand foot with one
hundred horse came to El&aelig;a from Achaia, Diophanes being
commander of all these forces; whom, on their landing,
persons, sent by Eumenes to meet them, conducted by
night to Pergamus. Veterans they all were, well skilled in
war; and their commander was a disciple of Philop&#339;men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1676" id="Page_1676">Pg 1676</a></span>
the most consummate general among the Greeks in that age.
They set apart two days to give rest to the men and horses,
and, at the same time, to view the posts of the enemy, and to
learn at what places, and what times, they advanced and retired.
The king&#8217;s troops generally approached to the foot of
the hill on which the town stands; so that the plundering in
the rear was unimpeded, as not a man ever sallied out, even
to throw darts from a distance, against their guards. After
that they were once driven in, and with fear confined themselves
within the walls, a contempt for them arises among the
king&#8217;s troops, and consequently negligence. The greater
number did not keep their horses either saddled or bridled;
while few remained under arms, and in the ranks; the rest,
slipping away, had scattered themselves every where over the
entire plain, some diverting themselves with youthful sports and
amusements, others eating in the shade, and some even stretched
on the ground asleep. Diophanes, having observed all these
particulars from the lofty city of Pergamus, ordered his men
to take arms, and to be ready at a particular gate. He himself
went to Attalus, and told him that he intended to attack the
out-posts of the enemy. Attalus giving his consent with reluctance,
as he saw that one hundred horse must fight against
six hundred, one thousand foot against four thousand, Diophanes
then marched out of the gate, and took post at a small
distance from the enemy&#8217;s guard, waiting his opportunity.
Both the people in Pergamus thought that it was madness
rather than daring, and the enemy, after observing his party
for a short time, as soon as they saw no movement among
them, did not change their usual negligence, ridiculing moreover
the smallness of their number. Diophanes for a long
time kept his men quiet, as if they had been brought out
merely for the purpose of looking about them; but as soon
as he perceived that the enemy had quitted their ranks, ordering
the infantry to follow as fast as they could, he himself,
with his own troop, led the way at the head of the cavalry,
and pushing on, with all possible speed, made a sudden charge
on the enemy&#8217;s party, while a shout was raised by every horseman
and footman at once. Not only were the men so attacked
terrified, but the horses also; and when they broke their collars,
they caused great confusion and tumult throughout. A
few of the horses, indeed, stood unaffrighted; but even these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1677" id="Page_1677">Pg 1677</a></span>
the troopers could not easily saddle, or bridle, or mount; for
the Ach&aelig;ans struck much greater terror than would be supposed
from so small a party of horse. But now the infantry,
in due order and preparation, assailed the enemy, dispersed
through their own negligence, and almost half asleep; and
slaughter and flight ensued in every part of the plain. Diophanes
pursued the runaways as far as he could with safety,
and then returned into garrison, after acquiring very great
honour for the Ach&aelig;an nation; for not only the men, but also
the women, had been spectators from the walls of Pergamus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a21" name="a21"></a>21</span>
Next day the enemy&#8217;s guard, in more regular and orderly
condition, pitched their camp five hundred paces farther
from the city, and the Ach&aelig;ans marched out at nearly the
same time as before, and to the same place. During many
hours, both parties intently awaited the assault, as if it were
about to take place immediately. When it was not far from
sun-set, the usual time of their returning to the main camp, the
king&#8217;s troops, forming in close order, began to retire in a body,
arranged for a march rather than for a battle. Diophanes
did not stir until they were out of sight; and then he rushed
on their rear-guard with the same vehemence as before, and
again excited such dismay and confusion, that, though the
hindmost were put to the sword, not one of them halted to
fight; they were driven into their camp in confusion, and
scarcely observing any order in their march. These daring
exertions of the Ach&aelig;ans obliged Seleucus to decamp, and
quit the territory of Pergamus. Antiochus, having learned
that the Romans and Eumenes were come to protect Adramyttium,
made no attempt on that city, but ravaged the country
adjoining. He afterwards reduced Per&aelig;a, a colony of
Mityleneans; Cotton, Corylenus, Aphrodisias, and Crene,
were all taken at the first assault. He then returned through
Thyatira to Sardis. Seleucus, remaining on the sea-coast, was
a terror to one party, a protection to the other. The Roman
fleet, with Eumenes and the Rhodians, retired, first to Mitylene,
and then to El&aelig;a, whence they had set out. On their
way to Phoc&aelig;a, they put in at an island called Bachius; it
is near the city of Phoc&aelig;a; and when they had plundered
the temples and statues, which they had before spared, (for
the island was surpassingly adorned with them,) they then
passed over to the city. When they, having divided the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1678" id="Page_1678">Pg 1678</a></span>
quarters among themselves, assaulted it, and saw that it could
not be taken by arms and scaling-ladders, without regular
works; after that a reinforcement of three thousand soldiers,
sent by Antiochus, had got into the city, they immediately
broke up the siege, and the fleet retired to the island, without
having effected any thing more than the devastation of the
enemy&#8217;s country in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a22" name="a22"></a>22</span>
It was then resolved that Eumenes should return home,
and make every necessary preparation for the passage of the
consul and his army over the Hellespont; and that the Roman
and Rhodian fleets should sail back to Samos, and remain
stationed there, that Polyxenidas might not make any movement
from Ephesus. The king returned to El&aelig;a, the Romans
and Rhodians to Samos. There, Marcus &AElig;milius, brother
of the pr&aelig;tor, died. After his obsequies were performed, the
Rhodians sailed, with thirteen of their own ships, one Coan,
and one Cnidian quinquereme, to Rhodes, in order that they
might take up a position there, against a fleet which was reported
to be coming from Syria. Two days before the arrival
of Eudamus and the fleet from Samos, another fleet of thirteen
ships, under the command of Pamphilidas, had been sent out
against the same Syrian fleet; and taking with them four
ships, which had been left to protect Caria, they relieved from
blockade D&aelig;dala, and several other fortresses of Per&aelig;a, which
the king&#8217;s troops were besieging. It was determined that
Eudamus should put to sea directly, and an addition of six
undecked ships was made to his fleet. He accordingly set
sail; and using all possible expedition, overtook the first
squadron at a port called Magiste, from whence they proceeded
in one body to Phaselis, resolving to wait there for
the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a23" name="a23"></a>23</span>
Phaselis stands on the confines of Lycia and Pamphylia;
it projects far into the sea, and is the first land seen
by persons coming from Cilicia to Rhodes, and from hence
ships can be seen at a great distance. For this reason, chiefly,
this place was made choice of, that they may lie in the way
of the enemy&#8217;s fleet. But in consequence of the unwholesomeness
of the place, and of the season of the year, (for it
was now the middle of summer,) and of the unusual stench,
diseases began to spread with violence, particularly among
the rowers, an event which they did not foresee. And having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1679" id="Page_1679">Pg 1679</a></span>
left the place from fear of this pestilence, when they were
sailing by the Pamphylian bay, their fleet putting into port at
the river Eurymedon, they hear from the people of Aspendus,
that the enemy are now at Sida. The king&#8217;s fleet had been
the slower in its passage, the season of the Etesi&aelig; being
opposed to them, for this is the periodical time for the north-west
winds. The Rhodians had thirty-two quadriremes and
four triremes. In the king&#8217;s fleet were thirty-seven ships of
the larger rates; among which were three of seven, and four
of six banks of oars; and besides these, ten triremes. They
discovered too, from some watch-tower, that the Rhodians
were at hand. Both fleets, at the dawn of the next day,
moved out of port, as if resolved to come to an immediate
engagement; and, as soon as the Rhodians passed the promontory
that stretches into the deep from Sida, they descried the
enemy, and were observed by them. On the king&#8217;s side,
Hannibal had the command of the left squadron, which
stretched away seaward; Apollonius, one of the nobles, had
the command of the right, and they had their ships already
formed in a line a-head. The Rhodians approached in a long
line. First was the admiral&#8217;s ship, with Eudamus in it;
Chariclitus brought up the rear; and Pamphilidas commanded
the centre division. When Eudamus saw the enemy&#8217;s
line formed and ready for battle, he pushed out towards the
main, ordering the ships that followed to form, regularly, as
they came up, in line of battle. This caused confusion at
first; for he had not stretched out to the main far enough
for the line of all the ships to form in the direction of the
land, and he himself hurrying on with precipitation, with
only five ships, engaged with Hannibal; the rest, having
received orders to form their line, did not come up. The rear
division had no room left for it next to the land; and, while
they were in disorder, the fight was already begun on the
right against Hannibal.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a24" name="a24"></a>24</span>
But the goodness of their ships, and the expertness of
their men in nautical business, quickly freed the Rhodians
from all embarrassment. They pushed out hastily towards
the main, and each made room next the land for the one
immediately behind; and when any made a stroke with its
beak against a ship of the enemy, it either shattered its prow,
or swept off its oars; or passing by it in the clear space
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1680" id="Page_1680">Pg 1680</a></span>
between the vessels, made an attack on its stern. One of the
king&#8217;s seven-banked ships being sunk with one stroke, by a
Rhodian vessel of much smaller size, discouraged them very much.
Therefore the right wing of the enemy was now undoubtedly
verging to flight. Hannibal, in the open sea, by
means chiefly of his superior number of ships, pressed hard
on Eudamus, who surpassed him in every other respect: and
he would have surrounded him were it not that, on the signal
being given from the admiral&#8217;s fleet, (by which it is usual to
collect together the fleet when dispersed,) all the ships which
had conquered on the right wing came speedily to bear aid to
their own party. This made Hannibal himself, with all his
division, betake themselves to flight; while the Rhodians
could not pursue, because their rowers being most of them
sick, were therefore the sooner wearied. When they were
recruiting their strength with food on the sea where they
brought to, Eudamus, observing the enemy towing, by means
of their open vessels, several damaged and crippled ships, and
seeing little more than twenty that were going off uninjured,
commanded silence from the castle of the commander&#8217;s ship,
and then called out, &#8220;Arise, and feast your eyes with an extraordinary
sight.&#8221; They all started up, and perceiving the
disorderly flight of the enemy, cried out, almost with one
voice, that they ought to pursue. Eudamus&#8217;s ship was bulged
in many places; he therefore ordered Pamphilidas and Chariclitus
to pursue as far as they should think it safe. They,
accordingly, pursued for a considerable time: but after that
Hannibal make-in close to the land, fearing to be wind-bound
on an enemy&#8217;s coast, they steered back to Eudamus, and with
difficulty towed to Phaselis a captured seven-banked ship,
which had been damaged in the beginning of the engagement.
They then sailed home to Rhodes, not so much exulting in
their victory as blaming one another because the entire fleet had
not been taken or sunk, when it could have been done. Hannibal,
disheartened by the loss of this one battle, did not even
then dare to sail past the coast of Lycia, though he wished to
join the king&#8217;s main fleet as soon as possible. And that this
action might not be unimpeded, the Rhodians sent Chariclitus
with twenty ships of war to Patara and the harbour of
Megiste. They then ordered Eudamus, with seven of the
largest vessels belonging to the fleet which he had commanded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1681" id="Page_1681">Pg 1681</a></span>
to rejoin the Romans at Samos, and to endeavour by
every argument, and by all his influence, to prevail on the
Romans to besiege Patara.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a25" name="a25"></a>25</span>
Now first of all the intelligence of the victory, and
subsequently the arrival of the Rhodians, caused great joy to
the Romans, and it appeared to them that if that anxiety was
taken away from the Rhodians, they would when at leisure render
the seas of that country safe. But the march of Antiochus
from Sardis did not allow them to quit the guard of Ionia and
&AElig;olia, lest the maritime cities should be crushed by his arms.
However, they sent Pamphilidas, with four decked ships, to
join the fleet which was at Patara. Antiochus not only collected
aids from the states that lay around, but also sent
to Prusias, king of Bithynia, ambassadors and letters, in
which he inveighed against the pressing of the Romans into
Asia. &#8220;They were coming,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to abolish all kingly
governments; so that there should be no empire in any part
of the world, save that of Rome. Philip and Nabis were subdued:
he was the third object of attack. Thus the conflagration
would spread, without interruption, from one to
another, as each lay nearest to the one last ruined, until it
enveloped them all. From him there was but one step to
Bithynia, now that Eumenes had submitted to voluntary servitude.&#8221;
Though Prusias was greatly affected by these observations,
his mind was relieved from all such doubts by a letter
from Scipio, the consul, and still more so by one from his brother
Africanus, who, besides urging the invariable practice of the
Roman people of augmenting, by every honourable addition,
the grandeur of kings in alliance with them, by instances taken
from his own family, induced Prusias to earn their friendship.
&#8220;The petty chieftains in Spain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who had been received
into alliance, he had left kings. Masinissa he had not
only re-established in his father&#8217;s kingdom, but had put him
in possession of that of Syphax, by whom he had been formerly
dethroned: so that he was, at the present, not only by
far the most powerful of all the kings in Africa, but equal,
both in dignity and strength, to any monarch in any part of
the world. Philip and Nabis, avowed enemies, were conquered
in war by Titus Quintius; nevertheless, they were
left in possession of their kingdoms. Philip even had the tributes
remitted to him last year, and his son, who was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1682" id="Page_1682">Pg 1682</a></span>
hostage, restored. Through the indulgence of the Roman
commanders, he had also got possession of several states
beyond the boundaries of Macedonia. As to Nabis, he might
have remained in the same honourable rank, had not first his
own madness, and afterwards the treachery of the &AElig;tolians,
brought him to ruin.&#8221; The king&#8217;s resolution was especially
confirmed after that Caius Livius, who had commanded the
fleet as pr&aelig;tor, came to him as ambassador from Rome, and informed
him how much better hope the Romans had of success
than Antiochus; and how much more sacred and lasting an
alliance with them would be.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a26" name="a26"></a>26</span>
Antiochus, after he lost the hope of an alliance with
Prusias, went from Sardis to Ephesus, to review the fleet
which was fitted out, and lay there ready, for several
months; rather because he saw it impossible, with his land
forces, to make any stand against the Roman army and its
commanders, the two Scipios, than that his naval force by
itself had ever been tried by him successfully, or afforded at
this juncture any great or well-grounded confidence. Yet
there was an incentive to hope on the present occasion; for
he had heard that a large portion of the Rhodian fleet was at
Patara, and that king Eumenes had gone to the Hellespont,
with all his ships, to meet the consul. Besides, the destruction
of the Rhodian fleet at Samos, on an opportunity prepared
by treachery, inspired some degree of confidence.
Relying on these things, he sent Polyxenidas with orders to
try, at all events, the fortune of a naval engagement; while
he himself marched his land forces to Notium. This town,
which belongs to Colophon, stands close to the sea, and is
distant about two miles from Old Colophon. He wished to
get this city into his power, because it was so near to Ephesus
that nothing could be done there, on sea or land, that was not
open to the view of the Colophonians, and, through them,
instantly made known to the Romans; and he had no
doubt that the latter, having heard of the siege, would
bring their fleet from Samos to the relief of an ally, which
would give Polyxenidas an opportunity of coming to action.
He therefore began to lay regular siege to the city, making
his approaches at the same time on the two sides next the
sea; in both places he joined his engines and mounds to
the wall, and brought up the rams under covered galleries.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1683" id="Page_1683">Pg 1683</a></span>
By which dangers the Colophonians being terrified, sent envoys
to Lucius &AElig;milius, at Samos, imploring the protection
of the pr&aelig;tor and people of Rome. His lying so long inactive
at Samos offended &AElig;milius, thinking nothing more improbable
than that Polyxenidas, whom he had twice challenged in vain
to fight, should ever offer him battle; and he considered it as
dishonourable, that the fleet of Eumenes should assist the consul
in conveying the legions into Asia, that he should be fettered
by bearing to the besieged Colophon an assistance destined
to have an uncertain end. Eudamus, the Rhodian, (who
had before prevailed upon him to stay at Samos, when he
wished to go to the Hellespont,) with all the other officers,
pressed him to comply, representing &#8220;how much more eligible
it would be, either to relieve confederates from a siege, or to
vanquish that fleet which he had vanquished before, and to
take from the enemy the entire possession of the sea, than, deserting
his allies, and delivering Asia to Antiochus by land
and sea, to depart from his own part of the war to the Hellespont,
when the fleet of Eumenes was sufficient for that station.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a27" name="a27"></a>27</span>
They accordingly, having set sail from Samos in quest of
provisions, their stock being consumed, were preparing to pass
over to Chios. Samos served as a granary to the Romans,
and thither all the store-ships sent from Rome directed their
course. When they had sailed round from the city to the
back of the island, which looks northward towards Chios and
Erythr&aelig;, and were preparing to cross over, the pr&aelig;tor is informed
by a letter, that a vast quantity of corn had arrived
at Chios, from Italy; but that the vessels laden with wine
were detained by storms. At the same time accounts were
received, that the people of Teos had furnished large supplies
of provisions to the king&#8217;s fleet, and had promised five thousand
vessels of wine. On this the pr&aelig;tor immediately changed
his course, and steered away to Teos, resolved either to make
use of the provisions prepared for the enemy, with the consent
of the inhabitants, or to treat them as foes. When they
had turned their prows to the land, about fifteen vessels appeared
in sight near Myonnesus, which the pr&aelig;tor at first
supposed to belong to the king&#8217;s fleet, and hastened to pursue.
It appeared afterwards, that they were piratical cutters and
galleys. They, having ravaged the sea-coast of Chios, returning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1684" id="Page_1684">Pg 1684</a></span>
with booty of every kind, betook themselves to flight
when they saw the fleet on the open sea. They had much
the advantage in swiftness, their galleys being lighter and constructed
for the purpose, and were nearer the land; therefore
before the fleet could overtake them, they made their escape to
Myonnesus. And the pr&aelig;tor, unacquainted with the place,
followed in expectation of forcing their ships from it out of
the harbour. Myonnesus is a promontory between Teos and
Samos. It consists of a hill rising from a pretty large base to
a sharp top, in the shape of an obelisk. From the land it has
access by a narrow path towards the sea, cliffs undermined by
the waves terminate it, so that in some places the superimpending
rocks project beyond the vessels that lie at anchor.
The ships not daring to approach lest they should be exposed
to the weapons of the pirates, who stood above on the cliffs,
wasted the day to no purpose. At length, after they had desisted
from this useless undertaking a little before night, they
the next day reached Teos. Here the pr&aelig;tor, after mooring
in the port at the back of the city, which the inhabitants call
Ger&aelig;sticum, sent out the soldiers to ravage the land about the
city.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a28" name="a28"></a>28</span>
The Teians, as these ravages passed under their eyes,
sent deputies to the Roman commander, carrying fillets, and
other badges of suppliants. And when they were exculpating
their state from every hostile act or word against the Romans,
he strongly charged them with &#8220;having assisted the enemy&#8217;s
fleet with provisions, and with having promised a quantity of
wine to Polyxenidas.&#8221; He further told them, that &#8220;if they
would furnish the same supplies to the Roman fleet, he would
recall his troops from plundering; otherwise, he would treat
them as enemies.&#8221; When the deputies carried back this distressing
answer, the people were summoned to an assembly
by the magistrates, to consult on what they should do. It
happened that Polyxenidas, who had sailed with the king&#8217;s
fleet from Colophon, after he heard that the Romans had left
Samos and pursued the pirates to Myonnesus, and that they were
laying waste the lands of the Teians, and that their fleet lay
in the harbour of Ger&aelig;sticus, cast anchor, in a retired harbour
of an island called by the sailors Macris, opposite to Myonnesus.
Then from his neighbouring position, exploring what
his enemies were doing, at first he was in great hopes of vanquishing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1685" id="Page_1685">Pg 1685</a></span>
the Roman fleet here, in like manner as he had vanquished
the Rhodian at Samos, by besetting the narrow
entrance at the mouth of the port. Nor is the nature of the
place unlike: by the promontories advancing towards each
other, the harbour is enclosed in such a manner, that two
ships can scarcely go out together. Polyxenidas intended to
seize this narrow pass in the night; and, while ten ships stood
at each of the promontories, to attack, from the right and left,
both sides of the enemy&#8217;s fleet sailing out, having landed his
armed men from the fleet, as he had done at Panormus, to
overpower the Romans on land and sea at once. And this
design would not have been formed by him in vain, had it not
appeared to the Romans better for receiving the provisions,
when the Teians had promised to execute their commands, that
the fleet should pass into that harbour, which is before the city.
It is said, also, that Eudamus, the Rhodian, had pointed out
the fault of the outer harbour, when two ships broke their oars
locked together in the narrow entrance. Among other motives,
this too induced the pr&aelig;tor to remove his fleet, because
there was danger from the land, as Antiochus kept his camp
not far from it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a29" name="a29"></a>29</span>
When the fleet was brought round to the city, all being
ignorant of the approach of the enemy, both soldiers and sailors
went on shore to divide the provisions, and the wine particularly,
among the ships; when, about mid-day, a peasant
happened to be brought before the pr&aelig;tor, who told him, that
the enemy&#8217;s fleet was lying at the island of Macris these two
days; and that, a little while ago, some of them were observed
to be in motion, as if preparing to sail. Greatly alarmed at
this unexpected event, the pr&aelig;tor ordered the trumpets to
sound, to call in such as might have straggled into the country,
and sent the tribunes into the city, to hasten the soldiers and
sailors on board. The confusion was not less than if the place
were on fire, or taken by an enemy; some running to call out
the men; others hurrying to the ships, while the orders of the
officers were confounded by irregular shouts, amid which the
trumpets raised their din, until at length the crowd collected
at the ships. Here scarcely could each know his own ship,
or make his way through the tumult; and the disorder would
probably have been productive of much mischief, on land and
sea had not &AElig;milius, in the commander&#8217;s ship, sailed out first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1686" id="Page_1686">Pg 1686</a></span>
into the main; where, receiving those following, he put each
into its own place, so as to form a line abreast: and Eudamus,
with the Rhodian fleet, waited at the shore, that the men
might be embarked without confusion, and that every ship
might leave the harbour as soon as it was ready. By these
means, the foremost division formed under the eye of the pr&aelig;tor,
while the rear was brought up by the Rhodians; and then
the whole line, in as regular order as if within sight of the
foe, advanced into the open sea. They were between Myonnesus
and the promontory of Corycus, when they first got
sight of the enemy. The king&#8217;s fleet, which was coming in
a long line, with only two vessels abreast, then formed themselves
in order of battle, stretching out their left division so
far, as that it might enclose the right of the Romans. When
Eudamus, who commanded in the rear, perceived that the
Romans could not form an equal front, but were just on the
point of being surrounded, he pushed up his ships. They
were Rhodians, by far the fastest sailers of any of the fleet;
and having filled up the deficiency in the extent of the line,
he opposed his own ship to the commander&#8217;s, on board of
which was Polyxenidas.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a30" name="a30"></a>30</span>
Now the entire fleets in every part were engaged in action.
On the side of the Romans eighty ships were fighting,
of which twenty-two were Rhodian. The enemy&#8217;s fleet consisted
of eighty-nine ships, and they had of the largest rates,
three of six, and two of seven banks. In the strength of the
vessels, and valour of the soldiers, the Romans had greatly
the advantage of the king&#8217;s party, as had the Rhodians in the
activity of their vessels, the skill of the pilots, and the dexterity
of the rowers. However, those which carried fire before
them were the greatest terror to the enemy: and what was the
sole cause of their preservation when they were surrounded
at Panormus, proved here the principal means of victory. For
when the king&#8217;s ships, through fear of the fire, had turned aside,
in order to avoid at the same time encountering the enemy&#8217;s
prow with their own, they could not strike their antagonist
with the beaks, but exposed the side of their ships to his
strokes; and if any did venture an encounter, it was immediately
overspread with the fire that was poured in; while
the men were more alarmed at the fire than the battle. However,
the bravery of the soldiers, as is generally the case,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1687" id="Page_1687">Pg 1687</a></span>
chiefly availed in deciding the battle. For the Romans, having
broke through the centre of the enemy&#8217;s line, tacked about
and fell upon the rear of the division which was engaged
with the Rhodians; and, in an instant of time, both Antiochus&#8217;s
centre division, and the ships on the left, were surrounded
and sunk. The squadron on the right, which was
still entire, was terrified rather by the disaster of their friends,
than by any immediate danger threatening themselves; but,
when they saw the others surrounded, and Polyxenidas&#8217;s ship
deserting its associates, and sailing away, having quickly
hoisted their topsails, they betook themselves to flight, (and
they steering for Ephesus had a favourable wind,) having lost
forty-two ships in that battle; of which thirteen struck, and
fell into the hands of the Romans; the rest were burned or
sunk. Two Roman ships were shattered, and several were
much damaged. One Rhodian vessel was taken by an extraordinary
casualty; for, on its striking a Sidonian ship with
its beak, its anchor, thrown out by the force of the shock,
caught fast hold of the other&#8217;s prow with its fluke, as if it
were a grappling-iron thrown in. Great confusion ensuing
thereon, when the Rhodians, who wished to disengage themselves
from the enemy, pulled back, its cable being dragged
forcibly, and at the same time entangled with the oars, swept
off one side of them. The very ship, which, when struck,
had grappled with it, took the Rhodian galley in its weakened
state. The naval battle at Myonnesus was fought principally
in this manner.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a31" name="a31"></a>31</span>
By which Antiochus being terrified, because, as he was
driven from the possession of the sea, he despaired of being
able to defend his distant possessions, ordered the garrison to
be withdrawn from Lysimachia, which plan was ill devised,
as the event subsequently proved, lest it should be there cut
off by the Romans. As it was easy for him, not only to defend
Lysimachia from the first attack of the Romans, but to protract
the siege through the whole winter; and by thus prolonging
the time, to reduce the besiegers to the extremity of
want; and in the mean time try the hope of peace, as opportunities
should present themselves. But, after the defeat at
sea, he not only gave up Lysimachia, but even raised the siege
of Colophon, and retired to Sardis. Here, bending all his
thoughts to one single object, that of meeting the enemy in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1688" id="Page_1688">Pg 1688</a></span>
the field, he sent into Cappadocia, to Ariarathes, to request
assistance, and to every other place within his power, to collect
forces. &AElig;milius Regillus, after his victory at sea, proceeded
to Ephesus, having drawn up his ships before the
harbour, when he had extorted from the enemy a final acknowledgment
of their having surrendered the dominion of
the sea, sailed to Chios, to which he had directed his course
from Samos, before the sea-fight. As soon as he had refitted
the ships that had been damaged in the battle, he sent off
Lucius &AElig;milius Scaurus, with thirty others, to the Hellespont,
to transport the army; and decorating the Rhodian
vessels with naval spoils, and allowing them a part of the
booty, he ordered them to return home. The Rhodians energetically
took the lead, and proceeded to assist in transporting
the consul&#8217;s forces, and when they had completed that service
also, then at length returned to Rhodes. The Roman fleet
sailed from Chios to Phoc&aelig;a. This city stands at the bottom
of a bay, and is of an oblong shape. The wall encompasses a
space of two miles and a half in length, and then contracts
on both sides into a very narrow wedge-like form, which place
they call Lampter (or the light-house). The breadth here
extends one thousand two hundred paces; and a tongue of
land stretching out about a mile into the sea, divides the bay
nearly in the middle, as if with a line; where it is connected
with the main land by a narrow isthmus, it has two very safe
harbours, turned to each side. The one that fronts the south
they call Naustathmos, (the station for ships,) from the circumstance
of its being capable of containing a vast number of
ships; the other is close to Lampter.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a32" name="a32"></a>32</span>
When the Roman fleet had taken possession of these
very safe harbours, the pr&aelig;tor thought proper, before he attempted
the fortifications, either by escalade or works, that
persons should be sent to sound the disposition of the magistrates
and principal people in the place: when he saw them
obstinate, he determined to attack the city in two places at
the same time. One part was thinly occupied by private
dwellings, temples of the gods occupying a great deal of the
ground. In that part first, having brought up the battering-ram,
he began to shake the wall and towers; and when
the multitude within ran thither to defend that spot, the battering-rams
were applied in the other quarter, and the walls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1689" id="Page_1689">Pg 1689</a></span>
were now knocked down in both places. On the fall of which,
when some of the Roman soldiers were making an assault over
the scattered masses of ruins, others attempted to scale walls;
the townsmen made such an obstinate resistance, as plainly
showed that they had a firmer dependence on their arms and
courage, than on their fortifications. The pr&aelig;tor, compelled
by the danger of the soldiers, sounded a retreat, that he might
not expose them incautious to his opponents, maddened with
despair and rage. The fighting being ended, the besieged
did not, even then, think of rest; but all hastened from every
quarter, to strengthen the walls, and to raise new ones in the
place of those that had been demolished. While they were
busily employed in this manner, Quintus Antonius, being
sent by the pr&aelig;tor, came to them, who, after having blamed
their obstinacy, assured them that &#8220;the Romans were more
anxious than they were themselves that the battle should
not be carried on to the destruction of the city. If they would
desist from their madness, &AElig;milius would allow them to capitulate
on the same terms on which they had formerly surrendered
to Caius Livius.&#8221; When they heard this, having taken
five days&#8217; time to deliberate, and having in the mean time
tried the hope of aid from Antiochus, after that the ambassadors
sent to the king had brought back word that there was
no aid in him, they opened their gates, stipulating that they
should suffer nothing hostile. When the troops were marching
into the city, and the pr&aelig;tor had proclaimed that it was
his pleasure that the surrendered townsmen should be spared,
there arose an universal clamour, &#8220;that it was shameful that
the Phoc&aelig;ans, who had never been faithful to any alliance,
and had always been bitter in enmity, should escape with
impunity.&#8221; After which words, as if a signal had been given
by the pr&aelig;tor, they ran, in parties, every way, to plunder the
city. &AElig;milius, at first, began to resist, and call them back,
saying, that &#8220;towns taken by storm, and not such as surrendered,
were plundered; and that, even with regard to
the former, the determination lay with the commander, not
with the soldiers.&#8221; But rage and avarice were too strong for
his authority; wherefore, despatching heralds through all
parts of the city, he ordered, that all persons of free condition
should come to him in the forum, that they should not be
injured: and in all things which were in his power, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1690" id="Page_1690">Pg 1690</a></span>
promise of the pr&aelig;tor was observed. He restored to them
their city, their lands, and their laws; and, as the winter now
approached, he chose the harbour of Phoc&aelig;a for his fleet to
pass the winter in.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a33" name="a33"></a>33</span>
About the same time it was announced to the consul, as
he was marching along the frontiers of the &AElig;nians and Maronites,
that the king&#8217;s fleet was conquered at Myonnesus, and that
Lysimachia was evacuated by its garrison. This latter event
gave much more satisfaction than even the success at sea;
especially after they came thither, and were hospitably received
in the city, filled with provisions of all sorts, as if provided
for the arrival of the army; when, in besieging the city,
they had anticipated extreme want and hardship. There they
made a halt for a few days, that the baggage and sick might
overtake them, who, overcome by diseases, or the length of
the way, had been left behind in all the forts of Thrace.
When all had joined, they began again their march through
the Chersonese, and arrived at the Hellespont; where every
thing requisite for their passage having been previously got
ready, by the care of king Eumenes, they crossed over, without
confusion, as if to friendly shores, no one opposing, and
the ships putting in at several different places. This raised
to a high degree the spirits of the Romans, who saw the passage
into Asia left open to them; which thing they supposed
would cost them a severe struggle. They afterwards remained
encamped a considerable time at the Hellespont, because it
happened to be a period too holy for marching, during which
the sacred shields are moved. The same festival had separated
Publius Scipio from the army, as the religious ceremony
was more incumbent on him, because he was one of
the Salian priests; and he himself was a source of delay, till
he overtook the rest of the army.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a34" name="a34"></a>34</span>
In the mean time an ambassador came from Antiochus
to the camp,&mdash;Heraclides, a Byzantian, having mandates concerning
peace. The delay and tardiness of the Romans
gave him great hope that this might be attained; for he had
imagined, that as soon as they set foot in Asia, they would
advance in a rapid march against the king. He resolved,
however, not to address himself to the consul until he had
first applied to Publius Scipio, and instructions to that effect
were given him by the king. In him he had the greatest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1691" id="Page_1691">Pg 1691</a></span>
hope, besides that his greatness of soul, and the fulness of
his glory, tended very much to make him inclined to peace,
and it was known to all nations what sort of a conqueror he
had been, both in Spain and afterwards in Africa; and also
because his son was then a prisoner with Antiochus. Where,
and when, and by what accident he became a prisoner, is, like
very many other things, not ascertained among writers. Some
say, that in the beginning of the war, as he was going from
Chalcis to Oreum, he was intercepted by some of the king&#8217;s
ships; others, that after the army came into Asia, he was sent
with a troop of Fregellans to Antiochus&#8217;s camp, to gain intelligence;
that on the cavalry sallying out against him, he retreated,
and having fallen from his horse in the confusion, he
was together with two horsemen, overpowered, and thus conducted
to the king. This however is fully ascertained, that
if peace had still subsisted with the Romans, and likewise a
personal friendship between the king and the Scipios, the
young man could not have been treated and courted with
greater kindness than he was. When the ambassador, for
these reasons, had waited the arrival of Publius Scipio, as
soon as he came he applied to the consul, and requested that
he should hear his instructions.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a35" name="a35"></a>35</span>
A full council being assembled, audience was given to
the ambassador, who said, that, &#8220;though many embassies
about peace had already been sent backwards and forwards,
without producing any effect, yet he conceived strong hopes
of obtaining it, because the former ambassadors had obtained
nothing. For the objects of contention in those discussions
were Smyrna and Lampsacus, Alexandria in the Troad, and
Lysimachia in Europe. Of these, the king had already ceded
Lysimachia, that they might not say that he possessed any
thing in Europe; and those cities which lay in Asia, he was
now ready to deliver up as well as any others, which the
Romans might wish to render independent of the king&#8217;s
government, because they belonged to their party. The king
was also willing to pay to the Roman people half the expense
of the war.&#8221; These were the conditions of peace. The rest
of his discourse was, &#8220;that, mindful of human affairs, they
should use with moderation their own good fortune, and not
press too severely on the misfortune of others; that they
should limit their empire by Europe; that single acquisitions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1692" id="Page_1692">Pg 1692</a></span>
could be made with more ease than that necessary for holding
them collectively. But if they would wish to take away some
part of Asia, provided that they would define it by indisputable
limits, the king, for the sake of peace and harmony, would
willingly suffer his own moderate temper to be overcome by
the insatiableness of the Romans.&#8221; These concessions, which
appeared to the ambassador of great moment towards obtaining
a peace, the Romans deemed trifling. They thought it
just, that &#8220;the king should defray the whole expense occasioned
by the war, because it was through his fault that
it was begun. And that, not only Ionia and &AElig;olia ought to
be evacuated by the king&#8217;s troops, but as all Greece had
been set free, so all the cities of that nation in Asia should
also be free. That this could be effected in no other way, than
by Antiochus relinquishing the possession of that part of
Asia on the hither side of Mount Taurus.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a36" name="a36"></a>36</span>
The ambassador, after he came to the conclusion that
he could obtain no reasonable terms in the council, tried to
influence the mind of Publius Scipio in private (for such were
his orders). First of all he told him that the king would
restore him his son without a ransom; and then, as ignorant
of the disposition of Scipio as he was of the Roman manners,
he promised an immense weight of gold, and, excepting the
title of king, an absolute partnership in the sovereignty, if
through his means he should obtain a peace. To which
Scipio answered, &#8220;I am the less surprised that you are ignorant
of the Romans in general, and of me, to whom you have
been sent, when I see that you are unacquainted with the
situation even of the person from whom you come. You
ought to have kept Lysimachia to prevent our entering the
Chersonese, or to have opposed us at the Hellespont to hinder
our passing into Asia, if you meant to ask peace from us as
from people solicitous about the issue of war. But after
leaving the passage into Asia open, and receiving not only a
bridle, but also a yoke, what negotiation on an equality has
been left you, when you must submit to orders? I shall
consider my son as a very great gift from the munificence of
the king; I pray to the gods that my circumstances may
never require others, my mind certainly never will require
any. For such an act of generosity to me he shall find me
grateful, if for a personal favour he will accept a personal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1693" id="Page_1693">Pg 1693</a></span>
return of gratitude. In my public capacity, I will neither
accept from him nor give him any thing. All that I can give
at present is sincere advice. Go then, and desire him in my
name, to cease hostilities, and to refuse no terms of peace.&#8221;
These words had no effect on the king, who thought that the
chance of war would be comparatively safe, since terms were
dictated to him already as if he were totally vanquished.
Laying aside, therefore, for the present, all farther mention of
peace, he turned his whole attention to the preparations for
war.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a37" name="a37"></a>37</span>
The consul having made every preparation for the
execution of his designs, when he had quitted the post
where he lay, marched first to Dardanus, and then to Rh&#339;teum;
from both states the people came out in crowds
to meet him. He then advanced to Troy, and having pitched
his camp in the plain which is under the walls, when he had
gone up to the city and into the citadel, he offered sacrifices
to Minerva, the guardian of the citadel; the Trojans, by
every act and expression of respect, showing themselves proud
of the Romans being descended from them, and the Romans
expressing their delight in their origin. The army marching
thence, arrived, on the sixth encampment, at the source of the
Caicus. To this place also king Eumenes came. He at
first endeavoured to bring back his fleet from the Hellespont
to El&aelig;a, for the winter; subsequently, when by adverse
winds he could not, for several days, pass the promontory of
Lectos, that he might not be absent at the commencement of
operations, he landed and came, with a small body of men, by
the shortest road to the Roman camp. From the camp he
was sent home to Pergamus, to hasten supplies of provisions;
and when the corn was delivered to the persons whom the
consul had ordered to receive it, he returned to the same camp.
The plan was, provisions for several days being prepared, to
march hence against the enemy, before the winter should
prevent them. The king&#8217;s camp was near Thyatira; and
Antiochus, hearing there that Publius Scipio had fallen sick
and was conveyed to El&aelig;a, sent ambassadors to conduct his
son to him. As this present was highly grateful to the mind
of the father, so was the satisfaction which it gave no less
salutary to his body. At length, being sated with the embraces
of his son, he said to the ambassadors, &#8220;Tell the king
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1694" id="Page_1694">Pg 1694</a></span>
that I return him thanks; that at present I can make him no
other requital than my advice; which is, not to come to an
engagement, until he shall have heard that I have rejoined
the army.&#8221; Although sixty-two thousand foot, and more than
twelve thousand horse, inspired the king at times with hopes
in the result of a battle; yet, moved by the advice of so great
a man as Scipio, in whom, when he considered the uncertainty
of the events of war, he placed safety in any reverse of fortune,
he retired, and having crossed the Phrygian river, pitched his
camp near Magnesia, which is at Sipylus. And lest, if he
wished to prolong the time, the Romans might attack his
works, he drew round it a fosse six cubits deep and twelve
broad, and on the outside surrounded the fosse with a double
rampart: on the inside bank, he raised a wall flanked with
towers at small distances, by which the enemy could easily
be prevented from crossing the fosse.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a38" name="a38"></a>38</span>
The consul, thinking that the king was still in the
neighbourhood of Thyatira, came down by continued marches
on the fifth day into the Hyrcanian plains. Then when he
heard that the other had departed, he followed his track, and
pitched his camp on the hither side of the Phrygian river, at
the distance of four miles from the enemy. Here, a body of
about one thousand horse, (the greatest part of whom were
Gallogr&aelig;cians, the rest Dahans, and archers on horseback, of
other nations intermixed,) passing the river with great tumult,
made an attack on the advanced Roman guards. First of all
they threw into confusion those unprepared; then, when the
contest continued longer, and the number of the Romans
increased, as succours were easily sent from the neighbouring
camp, the king&#8217;s troops, becoming weary and unable to withstand
superior numbers, endeavoured to retreat; but, before
they could reach the river, very many were killed on the
bank, by the enemy pressing on their rear. For two days
after there was quiet, neither party passing the river. On the
third, the Romans passed it with their whole force, and
encamped at the distance of about two miles and a half from
the enemy. While they were employed in measuring and
fortifying the camp, a body of the king&#8217;s troops, consisting
of three thousand chosen horse and foot, approached with
great rapidity and violence. The party on guard, though
much inferior in number, (being only two thousand,) without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1695" id="Page_1695">Pg 1695</a></span>
calling off any of the soldiers from the fortifying of the camp,
sustained the combat with equal success at first, and, in the
progress of the contest, repulsed the enemy, killing a hundred,
and taking about the same number. During the four
ensuing days, both armies stood in order of battle, before
their respective camps. On the fifth, the Romans advanced
into the middle of the plain, but Antiochus did not stir; so
that his rear was not so far as a thousand feet from his
rampart.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a39" name="a39"></a>39</span>
The consul, after perceiving that he declined the contest,
called a council next day, and asked their opinion, &#8220;how
he ought to act if Antiochus would not give him an opportunity
of engaging. For the winter was at hand, and he must
either keep the soldiers in camp; or, if they chose to retire
to winter quarters, defer the business of the war until summer.&#8221;
The Romans never despised any enemy so much. The
assembly on every side called on him to lead on immediately,
and make use of the present ardour of the troops; who, as if
the business were not to fight against so many thousands, but
to slaughter an equal number of cattle, were ready to force
their way, through trenches and ramparts, into the camp, if
the enemy would not come out to battle. Cneius Domitius
was sent to discover the nature of the ground, and on what
side the enemies&#8217; rampart could be approached; after he
returned with a full account of every particular, it was resolved
that the camp should next day be moved nearer to the
enemy. On the third day, the standards were carried forward
into the middle of the plain, and the soldiers began to form
line. Antiochus, thinking that he could hesitate no longer,
lest, by declining a battle, he should damp the courage of
his men, and add to the confidence of the enemy, drew out
his forces in person, advancing only so far from the enemy&#8217;s
camp as to make it apparent that he was willing to come to
an engagement. The Roman line was nearly uniform throughout
with respect to both men and armour. There were two
Roman legions, and two brigades of allies and Latins, each
containing five thousand four hundred men. The Romans
formed the centre, the Latins the wings. The spearmen composed
the first line, the first-rank men the second, and the
veterans closed the rear. Beyond this, which formed as it
were the regular line of battle, the consul formed on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1696" id="Page_1696">Pg 1696</a></span>
right of it, and in one continued line, the auxiliary troops of
Eumenes, intermixed with Ach&aelig;an targeteers, making about
three thousand foot; beyond these he posted somewhat less
than three thousand horse, of which, eight hundred belonged
to Eumenes; all the rest of the cavalry were Roman: and in
the extremity of the line he placed bodies of Trallians and
Cretans, equal in number, who were composed of five hundred
men each. His left wing did not appear to require such supports,
because a river and steep banks flanked it. However,
four troops of horse were posted there. This was the whole
amount of the Roman force, besides two thousand Macedonians
and Thracians, who had, as volunteers, accompanied the army.
These were left to guard the camp. They placed sixteen
elephants behind the veterans, in reserve. For besides that
they were not supposed capable of withstanding the great
number of the king&#8217;s elephants, which were no less than fifty-four,
the African elephants are not able to cope with an equal
number of Indians, either because they are inferior to them
in size, (in which the Indian have much the advantage,) or in
unyielding courage.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a40" name="a40"></a>40</span>
The king&#8217;s line was more chequered with troops of
many nations, dissimilar both in their persons and armour.
There was a body of sixteen thousand men armed after the
manner of the Macedonians, which were called a phalanx.
This formed the centre, and was divided in front into ten
parts. These parts were separated by two elephants placed
between each two; the line of soldiers was thirty-two ranks
deep from point to rear. This was the main strength of the
king&#8217;s army, and it exhibited a formidable sight, both in the
other particulars of its appearance, and in the elephants towering
so high among the soldiers. They were of huge bulk,
and the caparisons of their foreheads and crests, and the towers
fixed on their backs, with four armed men standing on each
tower, besides the managers of the beasts, gave them a terrific
appearance. On the right side of the phalanx, he placed five
hundred Gallogr&aelig;cian horsemen. To these he joined three
thousand horsemen clad in complete armour, whom they call
Cataphracti, or mailed. To these were added a brigade of
near a thousand horse, which they called Agema. They
were Medes, all picked men, with a mixture of horsemen from
many other nations in that part of the world. Adjoining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1697" id="Page_1697">Pg 1697</a></span>
these, a body of sixteen elephants was placed in reserve. On
the same side, a little farther on towards the wing, was the
royal cohort; these were called Argyraspides<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4]</a>, from the kind
of armour which they wore. Next to these stood one thousand
two hundred Dahan bowmen on horseback; then, three
thousand light infantry, part Cretans and part Trallians, the
number of each being equal; adjoining these, were two thousand
five hundred Mysian archers. Four thousand Cyrt&aelig;an
slingers and Elym&aelig;an archers mixed together covered the
flank of the wing. Next to the left flank of the phalanx, stood
one thousand five hundred Gallogr&aelig;cian horse, and two thousand
Cappadocians, (which were sent by king Ariarathes,)
wearing the same kind of armour; then, auxiliaries of all
kinds mixed together, two thousand seven hundred; then,
three thousand mailed horsemen; then, one thousand other
horsemen, being a royal cohort, equipped with lighter coverings
for themselves and their horses, but, in other respects,
not unlike the rest; they were mostly Syrians, with a mixture
of Phrygians and Lydians. In the front of this body of cavalry
were the chariots armed with scythes, and a kind of
camels called dromedaries. These were ridden by Arabian
archers, who carried thin swords four cubits long, that they
might be able to reach the enemy from so great a height.
Then followed another multitude, like that in the right wing,&mdash;first,
Tarentines; then, two thousand five hundred Gallogr&aelig;cian
horsemen; then, one thousand new Cretans, and one
thousand five hundred Carians and Cilicians, armed in the
same manner; then, an equal number of Trallians, with three
thousand targeteers (these were Pisidians, Pamphylians, and
Lycians); then came brigades of Cyrt&aelig;ans and Elym&aelig;ans,
equal to the auxiliaries placed on the right wing, and sixteen
elephants, separated by a small interval. The king himself
was in the right wing; the command of the left he gave to
his son Seleucus, and Antipater, the son of his brother; the
centre was intrusted to three, Minio, Zeuxis, and Philip, the
master of the elephants.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a41" name="a41"></a>41</span>
A morning mist, which as the day advanced rose up in
clouds, spread a general darkness; and the moisture issuing
from it, and coming from the southward, wetted every thing,
This circumstance, which was scarcely any inconvenience to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1698" id="Page_1698">Pg 1698</a></span>
the Romans, was very disadvantageous to the king&#8217;s troops.
For the indistinctness of the light did not take away from the
Romans the view of all parts of their line, since it was of
moderate length; and the moisture tended but little to blunt
their swords and javelins, as they were almost all heavy-armed
troops. The king&#8217;s soldiers, as the line was so extensive,
could not even see their wings from the centre, much
less could those at the extremities see one another; and then,
the moisture relaxed the strings of their bows, their slings,
and the thongs of their javelins. Besides, the armed chariots,
by means of which Antiochus had trusted utterly to disorder
the enemy&#8217;s line, turned the terror of their operations on their
owners. The manner in which they were armed was this:
from the yoke, on both sides of the pole, they had lances<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> ten
cubits long, projecting like horns, to transfix any thing that
came in their way. At each extremity of the yoke, two scythe-blades
projected, one on a line with the yoke, the other on
its lower side, pointing to the ground; the former to cut
through any thing that might come within its reach on the
side, the other to catch such as fell, or endeavoured to go
under it. At each extremity of the axle of the wheels, two
scythe-blades were fastened in the same manner. The king, as
we mentioned before, had placed the chariots so armed in the
front, because if they were placed in the rear, or between the
ranks, they must be driven through their own soldiers. Which
when Eumenes saw, not being ignorant of the method of opposing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1699" id="Page_1699">Pg 1699</a></span>
them, and knowing that aid of that sort might be rendered
as dangerous to one side as the other, if an opponent
should cast terror into the horses, rather than attack them in
a regular battle, ordered the Cretan bowmen, and slingers,
and javelin-bearers, with some troops of horse, not in a body,
but scattering themselves as widely as possible, to rush forwards,
and pour weapons on them from all sides at once. This
storm, as it were, partly by the wounds made by the missile
weapons thrown from every quarter, and partly by the discordant
shouts raised, so terrified the horses, that immediately,
as if unbridled, they galloped about at random. The light
infantry, the lightly-accoutred slingers, and the active Cretans,
quickly evaded their encounter. The horsemen, following
them, increased the tumult and the terror of the horses and
camels, which were likewise affrighted, the clamour being
multiplied and increased by the rest of the crowd of bystanders.
By these means, the chariots were driven out of the
ground between the two lines. When this fruitless mimicry
of war was over, both parties gave the signal, and advanced
to a regular engagement.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a42" name="a42"></a>42</span>
But that futile affair was soon the cause of real loss.
For the auxiliaries in reserve, which were posted next, being
terrified at the turn and disorder of the chariots, betook themselves
to flight, leaving all exposed as far as the post of the
mailed horsemen; to whom when the Roman cavalry, after dispersing
the reserves, approached, they did not sustain their
first onset. Some fled, and others, being delayed by the weight
of their coverings and armour, were put to the sword. The
whole left wing then gave way, and the auxiliaries, posted
between the cavalry and the phalanx, being thrown into confusion,
the terror spread even to the centre. Here the ranks
were broken, and by the flying soldiers rushing in between
them, the use of their long spears, called by the Macedonians
sarissas, was hindered. The Roman legions advanced and discharged
their javelins among them in disorder. Even the elephants,
standing in the way, did not deter the Roman soldiers,
who had learned by experience in the African wars, both to
evade the onset of the animal, and, getting at one side of it,
either to ply it with darts, or, if they could come near enough,
to wound its sinews with their swords. The front of the centre
was now almost crushed, and the reserve, being surrounded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1700" id="Page_1700">Pg 1700</a></span>
was attacked on the rear, when the Romans perceived their
troops in another quarter flying, and heard shouts of dismay
almost close to their camp. For Antiochus, who commanded
the right wing, having observed that the enemy, through
confidence in the river, had placed no reserve there, except
four troops of horse, and that these, keeping close to the infantry,
left an open space on the bank of the river, made a
charge on them, with a body of auxiliaries and mailed horsemen.
He not only attacked them in front, but having surrounded
the wing in the direction of the river, pressed them
in flank also; until the routed cavalry first, and then the infantry
that were next them, fled with precipitation to the
camp.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a43" name="a43"></a>43</span>
Marcus &AElig;milius, a military tribune, son of Marcus
Lepidus, who, in a few years after, became chief pontiff, had
the charge of the camp. He, when he saw the troops flying,
went out, with his whole guard, to meet them. He ordered
them, first, to halt, and then to return to the fight; at the
same time upbraiding them with cowardice and disgraceful
flight. He then proceeded to threats,&mdash;that if they did not
obey his orders, they would rush blindly on their own destruction.
At last he gave orders to his own men to kill the foremost
of the runaways, and with sword-wounds to drive the
crowd of fugitives back against the enemy. The greater fear
now overcame the less. Compelled by the danger on either
side, they first halted, and then returned to the encounter, and
&AElig;milius, with his guard, consisting of two thousand men of
distinguished valour, gave a vigorous check to the furious
pursuit of Antiochus. At the same time, Attalus, the brother
of Eumenes, came up in good time with two hundred horse
from the right wing, by which the left of the enemy had been
routed, at the beginning of the engagement, as soon as he
observed the flight of his friends on the left, and the tumult
near the camp. When Antiochus saw those men renewing
the fight, whom, but just before, he had seen running away,
and another large body advancing from the camp, with a third
from the line, he turned his horse to flight. The Romans,
thus victorious in both wings, advanced over heaps of slain,
(which had been raised principally in the centre, where the
strength of the bravest men and the armour by its weight
had prevented flight,) to plunder the camp. The horsemen of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1701" id="Page_1701">Pg 1701</a></span>
Eumenes first, and then the rest of the cavalry, pursued the
enemy through all parts of the plain, and killed the hindmost
as they overtook them. But the fugitives suffered more severe
loss by the chariots, elephants, and camels intermixed,
and by their own disorderly crowd; for, after they once broke
their ranks, they rushed, as if blind, one upon another, and
were trodden to death by the trampling of the beasts. In the
camp also there was great slaughter committed, rather greater
than even in the field; for the flight of the first generally
tended to the camp. The guard, through confidence in the
great number of these, defended their works with the more
obstinacy. The Romans having been stopped at the gates and
rampart, which they had expected to take at the first rush,
when they did at length break through, actuated by rage,
made the more dreadful carnage.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a44" name="a44"></a>44</span>
Up to fifty thousand foot and three thousand horse are
said to have been killed that day; one thousand four hundred
taken, with fifteen elephants and their drivers. Of the Romans,
many were wounded, but no more than three hundred
foot and twenty-four horsemen killed; and of the troops of
Eumenes, twenty-five. That day the victors, after plundering
the enemy&#8217;s camp, returned with great store of booty to
their own. On the day following, they stripped the bodies of
the slain, and collected the prisoners. Ambassadors came
from Thyatira and Magnesia, near Sipylus, with a surrender
of those cities. Antiochus fled, with very few attendants;
but greater numbers collecting about him on the road, he arrived
at Sardis, with a tolerable body of soldiers, about the
middle of the night. Then when he heard that his son Seleucus
and several of his friends had gone on to Apamea, he
likewise at the fourth watch set out for Apamea with his
wife and daughter, having committed to Zeno the command
of the city, and having placed Timon over Lydia; which
being disregarded, ambassadors are sent to the consul, by the
unanimous voice of the citizens and soldiers who were in the
garrison.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a45" name="a45"></a>45</span>
About this time deputies came from Tralles, from Magnesia
on the Masander, and from Ephesus, to surrender those
cities. Polyxenidas had quitted Ephesus, as soon as he heard
or the battle; and, sailing with the fleet as far as Patara, in
Lycia, where, through fear of the Rhodian fleet stationed at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1702" id="Page_1702">Pg 1702</a></span>
Megiste, he landed, and, with a small retinue, pursued his
journey, by land, into Syria. The several states of Asia placed
themselves under the protection of the consul and the dominion
of the Roman people. He was now at Sardis, whither Publius
Scipio came from El&aelig;a, as soon as he was able to endure the
fatigue of travelling. Shortly after, a herald from Antiochus
solicited through Publius Scipio, and obtained from the consul,
permission for the king to send ambassadors. In a few days&#8217;
time, Zeuxis, who had been governor of Lydia, and Antipater,
the king&#8217;s nephew, arrived. These, having first had a meeting
with Eumenes, whom they expected to find most averse to peace,
on account of old disputes, and seeing him better disposed
than they or the king could have hoped, addressed themselves
then to Publius Scipio, and through him to the consul: and a
numerously attended council being granted to them at their
request to declare their commission, Zeuxis said, &#8220;we have not
any thing to propose ourselves, but rather to inquire from you,
Romans, by what atonements we can expiate the error of our
king, and obtain pardon and peace from our conquerors.
You have ever pardoned, with the greatest magnanimity, vanquished
kings and nations. With how much greater and
more placable spirit ought you to act now, after your late
victory, which has made you masters of the whole world!
You ought now, like deities laying aside all disputes with
mortal beings, to protect and spare the human race.&#8221; It had
been determined, before the ambassadors came, what answer
should be given them; and it was agreed that Africanus
should deliver it. He is said to have spoken thus: &#8220;Of those
things that are in the gift of the immortal gods, we, Romans,
possess as much as the gods have been pleased to bestow.
In every state of fortune we have had, and have, the same
spirit for this, under the sway of our reason: prosperity has
never elated, nor adversity depressed it. Of the truth of this,
(to omit other instances,) I might produce your friend Hannibal
as a convincing proof: but I can appeal to yourselves.
We now conquerors offer to you conquered the same conditions
which we offered to you when on an equal footing, at the
time that you made proposals of peace, after we crossed the
Hellespont, before we beheld the king&#8217;s camp or army, when
the chance of war was equal and the issue uncertain. Resign
all pretensions in Europe, and cede that part of Asia which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1703" id="Page_1703">Pg 1703</a></span>
lies on this side of Mount Taurus. Then, towards the expenses
of the war, ye shall pay fifteen thousand talents of Eub&#339;a;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
five hundred immediately, two thousand five hundred when the
senate and people of Rome shall have ratified the peace, and one
thousand annually for twelve years after. It likewise pleases us,
that four hundred talents be paid to Eumenes, and the quantity
of corn remaining unpaid, of what was due to his father.
When we shall have settled these articles, it will be a sort of
pledge, that we may consider it certain that you will perform
them, if you give twenty hostages such as we shall choose.
But it never will be clear to us that the Roman people will
enjoy peace where Hannibal shall be. Him, therefore, we
demand, above all. Ye shall also deliver up Thoas, the &AElig;tolian,
the fomenter of the &AElig;tolian war, who armed you against
us by the assurances of their support, and them by assurances
of yours; and, together with him, Mnesilochus, the Acarnanian,
and Philo, and Eubulidas, of Chalcis. The king will
now make peace under worse circumstances on his side, because
he makes it later than he might have done. If he now
causes any delay, let him consider, that it is more difficult to
pull down the majesty of kings from the highest to the middle
stage, than it is to precipitate it from the middle to the
lowest.&#8221; The ambassadors were sent by the king with these
instructions, that they should accede to any terms of peace.
It was resolved, therefore, that ambassadors should be sent to
Rome. The consul distributed his army in winter quarters
at Magnesia, on the M&aelig;ander, Tralles, and Ephesus. A
few days after, the king brought the hostages to Ephesus to
the consul; the ambassadors also, who were to go to Rome,
arrived. Eumenes set out for Rome at the same time with
the king&#8217;s ambassadors, and they were followed by embassies
from all the states of Asia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a46" name="a46"></a>46</span>
Whilst these things are being transacted in Asia, two
proconsuls arrived almost together at Rome, from their provinces,
with hopes of triumphing: Quintus Minucius, from
Liguria, and Manius Acilius, from &AElig;tolia. After hearing
their services, the senate refused a triumph to Minucius,
but, with great unanimity, decreed one to Acilius, and he rode
through the city in triumph over king Antiochus and the
&AElig;tolians. In the procession were carried, two hundred and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1704" id="Page_1704">Pg 1704</a></span>
thirty military ensigns; of unwrought silver, three thousand

and of great weight. He bore, also, the king&#8217;s silver,
furniture, and splendid wardrobe; golden crowns, presents
from the allied states, forty-five; with spoils of all kinds.
He led thirty-six prisoners of distinction, generals of the
&AElig;tolian and royal armies. Damocritus, the &AElig;tolian general,
a few days before, when he had escaped out of prison in the
night, being overtaken by the guards on the bank of the
Tiber, stabbed himself with a sword before he was seized.
Nothing was wanted but the soldiers, to follow the general&#8217;s
chariot; in every other respect the triumph was magnificent,
both in the grandeur of the procession and the fame of his
achievements. Sad intelligence from Spain diminished the
joy of this triumph, viz. that in an unsuccessful battle in the
territory of the Bastitani, under the command of Lucius &AElig;milius,
the proconsul, at the town of Lycon, there fell six thousand
of the Roman army against the Lusitanians; and that
the rest, being driven in a panic within their rampart, found
it difficult to defend the camp, and had retreated, by forced
marches, as if flying, into a friendly country. Such were the
accounts from Spain. Lucius Aurunculeius, the pr&aelig;tor, introduced
to the senate the deputies of Placentia and Cremona,
in Cisalpine Gaul. When they complained of the want of
colonists, some having been carried off by the casualties of
war, others by sickness, and several having left the colonies,
through disgust at the vicinity of the Gauls; on this, the senate
decreed, that &#8220;Caius L&aelig;lius, the consul, if he thought proper,
should enrol six thousand families, to be distributed among
these colonies, and that Lucius Aurunculeius, the pr&aelig;tor,
should appoint commissioners to conduct the colonists.&#8221; Accordingly,
Marcus Atilius Serranus, Lucius Valerius Flaccus,
son of Publius, and Lucius Valerius Tappo, son of Caius,
were nominated to that office.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a47" name="a47"></a>47</span>
Not long after, as the time of the consular elections
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1705" id="Page_1705">Pg 1705</a></span>
drew nigh, the consul, Caius L&aelig;lius, came home to Rome from
Gaul. He not only enrolled the colonists, according to a decree
of the senate, passed in his absence, as a supplement to Cremona
and Placentia, but proposed,&mdash;and, on his recommendation,
the senate voted,&mdash;that two new colonies should be established
in the lands which had belonged to the Boians. At the same
time arrived a letter from the pr&aelig;tor, Lucius &AElig;milius, containing
intelligence of the sea-fight that took place at Myonesus, and
of Lucius Scipio the consul having transported his
army into Asia. A supplication for one day was decreed, on
account of the naval victory, and another, for the second day,
in order that, as the Roman army had then for the first time
pitched a camp in Asia, this circumstance might turn out
prosperous and happy. The consul was ordered to sacrifice
twenty of the greater victims on occasion of each supplication.
The election of consuls was then held with a warm contest.
Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus sought the office under general
censure, for having, in order to sue for the office, left his
province of Sicily without having asked the senate for
permission to do so. Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, Cneius
Manlius Vulso, and Marcus Valerius Messala, were his competitors
for the office. Fulvius alone was elected consul,
since the rest could not make up the number of centuries;
and the next day, rejecting Lepidus, (for Messala
had declined,) he declared Cneius Manlius his colleague.
Then were chosen pr&aelig;tors, two of the name of Quintus Fabius,
Labeo and Pictor, (the latter of whom had in that year been
inaugurated flamen quirinalis,) Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus,
Spurius Posthumius Albinus, Lucius Plautius Hyps&aelig;us,
and Lucius B&aelig;bius Dives.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a48" name="a48"></a>48</span>
Valerius Antias says, that at the time when Marcus
Fulvius Nobilior and Cneius Manlius Vulso were consuls,
a rumour prevailed strongly at Rome, and was received
as almost certain, that the consul, Lucius Scipio, and with
him Publius Africanus, had been invited by the king to a
conference, under pretence of restoring young Scipio, and
were both seized, and that when the leaders were thus made
prisoners, the enemy&#8217;s army was immediately led up to the
Roman camp, that this was stormed, and the forces entirely
cut off; that in consequence of this, the &AElig;tolians had taken
courage and refused to obey orders; and that several of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1706" id="Page_1706">Pg 1706</a></span>
principal men had gone into Macedonia, Dardania, and
Thrace, to hire auxiliaries; that Aulus Tarentius Varro, and
Marcus Claudius Lepidus, had been sent by Aulus Cornelius,
propr&aelig;tor, from &AElig;tolia, to carry this intelligence to Rome.
To this story Valerius annexed that the &AElig;tolian ambassadors
were asked in the senate this question among others, from
whom they had heard that the Roman generals were made
prisoners by king Antiochus in Asia, and the army cut
off; and that the &AElig;tolians answered, that they had been informed
of it by their own ambassadors, who were with the
consul. As I have no other authority for this report, it has
neither been confirmed in my opinion, nor has it been overlooked
as groundless.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a49" name="a49"></a>49</span>
When the &AElig;tolian ambassadors were brought to an
audience of the senate, although their cause and their circumstances
required, that they, by an ample confession, should
suppliantly seek pardon for what was either their misfortune or
their fault, yet having begun with enumerating their services
to the Roman people, and talking reproachfully of their own
valour in the war with Philip, they offended the ears of the
senators by the insolence of their discourse. By calling up
old and forgotten matters, they brought the affair to this,
that the memory of many more injuries than services done by
that nation occurred to the minds of the senate; and that
they, who needed compassion, provoked anger and hatred.
They were asked by one senator whether they yielded the
disposal of themselves to the Roman people; then, by another,
whether they would have the same allies and enemies as the
Roman people: when they gave no answer, they were ordered
to withdraw from the senate-house. The whole senate then,
almost with one voice, cried out, that &#8220;the &AElig;tolians were
still entirely devoted to Antiochus; and that on that solitary
hope their spirits depended. Wherefore the war ought to be
carried on against such decided enemies, and their haughty
spirits tamed.&#8221; Another circumstance inflamed the resentment
of the senate, because that, in the very moment in which
they were soliciting peace from the Romans, they were
making war on Dolopia and Athamania. A decree of the
senate was passed, on the motion of Manius Acilius, who had
defeated Antiochus and the &AElig;tolians, that &#8220;the &AElig;tolian
ambassadors should be ordered to leave the city that day, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1707" id="Page_1707">Pg 1707</a></span>
quit Italy within fifteen days.&#8221; Aulius Terentius Varro
was appointed to escort them on the road; and a threatening
notice was given to them, that, &#8220;if any embassy from
the &AElig;tolians should thenceforth come to Rome, unless with
the permission of the general who might be in command of
that province, and with a Roman deputy, all such would be
treated as enemies.&#8221;&mdash;In this manner were the &AElig;tolians dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a50" name="a50"></a>50</span>
The consuls then consulted the senate concerning the
provinces; and it was resolved that they should cast lots for
&AElig;tolia and Asia. To him who should obtain by lot Asia,
was assigned the army which Lucius Scipio then had; and,
as a reinforcement, four thousand Roman foot and two hundred
horse, and of the allies and Latins eight thousand foot
and four hundred horse: with which force he was to carry
on the war with Antiochus. To the other consul was decreed
the army in &AElig;tolia; and he was allowed to raise, for a
reinforcement, the same number of natives and allies as his
colleague. The same consul was likewise ordered to equip
and take with him the ships that had been fitted out the year
before; and not only to wage war with the &AElig;tolians, but
also to pass over into the island of Cephallenia. Instructions
were given to the same consul, that if he could do it to the
advantage of the republic, he should come home to Rome to
hold the elections; for, besides that the annual magistrates
were to be replaced, it was resolved that censors also should
be created; and if any particular business should detain him,
he was then to acquaint the senate, that he could not attend
at the time of the elections. &AElig;tolia fell by lot to Marcus
Fulvius; Asia, to Cneius Manlius. The pr&aelig;tors then cast
lots, and Spurius Postumius Albinus obtained the city and
foreign jurisdiction; Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus, Sicily;
Quintus Fabius Pictor, the priest of Romulus, Sardinia;
Quintus Fabius Labeo, the fleet; Lucius Plautius Hyps&aelig;us,
Hither Spain; Lucius B&aelig;bius Dives, Farther Spain. One
legion, and the squadron which was then in Sicily, were decreed
for that province; and it was ordered that the new
pr&aelig;tor should levy on the Sicilians two tenths of the corn; one
of which he was to send into Asia, the other into &AElig;tolia. It
was also ordered, that the same impost should be collected in
Sardinia, and the corn sent to the same armies as the Sicilian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1708" id="Page_1708">Pg 1708</a></span>
corn. A reinforcement was given to Lucius B&aelig;bius, for Spain,
one thousand Roman foot and fifty horse, with six thousand
Latin foot and two hundred horse. To Plautius Hyps&aelig;us,
for the Hither Spain, were assigned one thousand Roman foot,
and two thousand Latins, with two hundred horse; so that
with these supplies the two Spains should have each a legion.
In the case of the magistrates of the preceding year, the command
was prolonged to Caius L&aelig;lius for a year, with his present
army, and to Publius Junius, the propr&aelig;tor in Etruria,
with the army which, was then in the province, and Marcus
Tuccius, the propr&aelig;tor in Bruttium and Apulia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a51" name="a51"></a>51</span>
Before the pr&aelig;tors went into their provinces, a dispute
arose between Publius Licinius, chief pontiff, and Quintus
Fabius Pictor, priest of Romulus; such as had happened in
the recollection of their fathers, between Lucius Metellus and
Postumius Albinus. Metellus, who was chief pontiff at the
time, had detained, for the performance of the business of
religion, Albinus, the consul, who was setting out with his
colleague, Caius Lutatius, to the fleet at Sicily; and now
Publius Licinius detained the pr&aelig;tor Fabius from going to
Sardinia. The matter was agitated in stormy debates, both
in the senate and before the commons: authoritative commands
were issued on both sides, pledges were seized, fines
imposed, the tribunes applied to, and appeals made to the
people. At last religion prevailed, so that the flamen obeyed
the order of the pontiff; and the fines were remitted by order
of the people. The senate by their authority prevented the
pr&aelig;tor when attempting to abdicate the magistracy through
anger at the loss of his province, and decreed that he should
dispense justice among foreigners. The levies being finished
in a few days, (for the soldiers to be enlisted were not many,)
the consuls and pr&aelig;tors repaired to their provinces. Then a
report of the transactions in Asia spread vaguely without an
author; and in a few days after, certain information, and a
letter from the general, arrived at Rome; which occasioned
joy, not so much from recent fear, (for they had ceased to fear
him who was conquered in &AElig;tolia,) as from former fame;
because by them commencing this war he was considered as a
very formidable enemy, both on account of his own strength
and because he had Hannibal to direct the business of the
war. The senate determined that no change should be made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1709" id="Page_1709">Pg 1709</a></span>
in their sending the consul into Asia, and that no diminution
of his forces should take place through apprehension of a war
with the Gauls.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a52" name="a52"></a>52</span>
In a short time after, Marcus Aurelius Cotta, deputy
from Lucius Scipio, with ambassadors from king Antiochus
and king Eumenes, and the Rhodian delegates, arrived at
Rome. Cotta, first in the senate, and then by their order in
the assembly of the people, stated the services which were
performed in Asia. Then a supplication for three days was
decreed, and forty victims of the greater kinds ordered to
be sacrificed. Then audience was given first to Eumenes.
He, when he had briefly returned thanks to the senate, &#8220;because
they had relieved him and his brother from a siege,
and protected his kingdom from the unjust attacks of Antiochus&#8221;
and had congratulated them &#8220;because they had
carried on affairs successfully by sea and land, and because
they had utterly routed, driven out of his camp, and expelled
king Antiochus, first from Europe, and then from
all Asia on this side of Mount Taurus;&#8221; then said &#8220;he preferred
that they should learn his own deserts from their
generals and deputies, rather than from his mouth.&#8221; All
being pleased with his discourse, and desiring him to tell
frankly, bashfulness being for the present laid aside, &#8220;what
recompence he thought proper to be given by the senate and
people of Rome;&#8221; assuring him that &#8220;the senate were inclined
to act with greater zeal and more abundant liberality,
if possible, according to his deserts.&#8221; To this the king
answered, &#8220;if the choice of rewards were offered him by
others, if only permission to consult the Roman senate were
given to him, he would have availed himself of the advice of
that most noble body, lest he might appear to have been either
immoderate in his desires or shameless in his requests. But
now, when they themselves were the donors, it was much
more proper that their munificence towards him and his
brothers should be regulated by their own judgment.&#8221; The
senate were not discouraged by this answer from desiring him
to speak; and when there had been a long contest of kindness
on one side, and reserve on the other, whilst they deferred to
one another with a politeness not more mutual than insuperable,
Eumenes departed from the senate-house. The senate
persisted in their resolution so far as to say, &#8220;that it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1710" id="Page_1710">Pg 1710</a></span>
absurd that the king should not know with what hopes or
request he came. That he himself best knew what would be
suitable to his own dominions. He was much better acquainted
with Asia than were the senate. That he ought to
be called back and compelled to state what were his wishes
and sentiments.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a53" name="a53"></a>53</span>
The king, being brought back by the pr&aelig;tor into the
senate-house, and desired to speak freely, began thus: &#8220;Conscript
fathers. I should have persevered in being silent, but that
I knew you would presently call in the Rhodian ambassadors,
and that when they had been heard, the necessity of speaking
would be imposed on me. And this my speech will be the
more difficult on this account, because their demands will be
of such a nature, that they will appear not only to make no
demands which may be contrary to my interests, but not
even to request any thing which may be intimately connected
with themselves. For they will plead the cause of the
Grecian states, and allege that they ought to be set free;
which point being gained, to whom is it doubtful that they
will alienate from us not only those states which shall be
liberated, but likewise our ancient tributaries; and that after
having bound them under so great an obligation, they will
keep them under the denomination of allies, in reality subject
to their government and entirely at their disposal? And, if
it pleases the gods, while they will aspire to this so great
power, they will pretend that this is no way connected with
them; they will only say, that it is becoming you and conformable
to your past conduct. You must be cautious, therefore,
lest this speech deceive you; and lest by an unfair
distribution, you not only depress some of your allies too
much, while you exalt others beyond measure, but also put
those who bore arms against you in a better state than your
allies and friends. As to what regards myself in other cases,
I should prefer to appear to any one to have yielded within
the limit of my right, rather than to have struggled too
obstinately in maintaining it; but in a contest of friendship
and good-will towards you, and of the respect to be paid to
you, I cannot with any patience bear to be outdone. This
was the principal inheritance that I received from my father;
who, of all the inhabitants of Asia and Greece, was the first
who embraced your friendship; and this he maintained with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1711" id="Page_1711">Pg 1711</a></span>
constant and invariable fidelity to the last hour of his life.
Nor did he display merely a faithful and kind inclination
towards you, but was actively engaged in all the wars which
you waged in Greece, whether on land or sea; he aided you
with all kinds of provisions in such a manner, that not one of
your allies could vie with him in any respect; and finally,
while he was exhorting the B&#339;otians to an alliance with you,
having fainted in the middle of his discourse, he shortly expired.
In his steps have I trodden; and though I could not
surpass the warmth of his wishes, and his zeal in courting
your friendship&mdash;for these could not be exceeded&mdash;yet fortune,
the times, Antiochus, and the war waged in Asia, afforded
me occasions of surpassing him in real acts and merits,
and valuable services. Antiochus, king of Asia, and of a
part of Europe, offered me his daughter in marriage; offered
to restore immediately the states that had revolted from us,
and gave great hopes of enlarging my dominions, if I would
have carried on war in conjunction with him against you. I
will not boast on this account, because I was guilty of no
trespass against you; but I will rather mention those
instances of conduct which are worthy of the very early
friendship between our house and you. I assisted your commanders
with forces by land and sea, so that not one of your
allies can stand in competition with me. I supplied them
with provisions by land and sea. I was present in all the
naval engagements which are fought in many places; and I
never was sparing of my labour and danger. I underwent
a siege, the most dreadful suffering that can occur in war,
being shut up in Pergamus, in the utmost danger both
of my kingdom and of my life. Afterwards when liberated
from the siege, although in one part Antiochus, in another
Seleucus, were encamped about the citadel of my kingdom,
having deserted my own affairs, I went with my whole fleet
to the Hellespont, to meet your consul Lucius Scipio, to
assist in transporting his army. From the time that the
army came over into Asia, I never quitted the consul; no
Roman soldier was more regular in his attendance in your
camp, than I and my brothers. No expedition, no cavalry
action, was undertaken without me. In the field I took that
post, and I maintained that ground, in which the consul
wished me to be. I do not intend, conscript fathers, to say who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1712" id="Page_1712">Pg 1712</a></span>
in that war can be compared to me in services towards you.
I would not hesitate to compare myself to any of those nations
or kings whom you hold in great honour. Masinissa was
your enemy before he became your ally; nor did he repair to
you with his auxiliaries when his kingdom was safe; but
dethroned, exiled, and stripped of all his forces, he fled for
refuge to your camp with one troop of horse. Nevertheless,
because he faithfully and diligently adhered to your cause in
Africa, against Syphax and the Carthaginians, you not only
restored him to the throne of his father, but by adding to his
domain the most opulent part of the kingdom of Syphax,
rendered him the most potent of all the kings in Africa.
What reward then, and what honour are we worthy of at your
hands, who have never been foes, but always allies? My
father, myself, my brothers, have carried arms in your cause
by sea and land, not only in Asia, but in countries remote
from our home; in Peloponnesus, in B&#339;otia, in &AElig;tolia,
during the wars with Philip, and Antiochus, and the &AElig;tolians.
Some one may say, what therefore do you demand?
Conscript fathers, since I must obey you when you desire me
to explain my wishes: if you have removed Antiochus beyond
the mountains of Taurus with the intention of holding those
countries yourselves, I wish for no other people to settle near
me, no other neighbours than you; nor could I hope that my
kingdom would be rendered safer or firmer by any other
event. But if your purpose is to retire hence, and withdraw
your armies, I may venture to affirm, that not one of your
allies is more deserving than I am of possessing what you
have acquired. But then it will be a glorious act to liberate
states that are in slavery. I agree that it will, provided they
have committed nothing hostile against you. But if they
took part with Antiochus, is it not much more becoming your
wisdom and equity, to consult the interest of your well-deserving
friends than that of your enemies?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a54" name="a54"></a>54</span>
The king&#8217;s speech was pleasing to the senate, and it
was very evident that they would do all things liberally, and
with a desire to serve him. As one of the Rhodian ambassadors
was absent, an embassy from Smyrna was next
introduced, which was briefly disposed of. When the Smyrn&aelig;ans
were highly complimented because they had resolved to
endure the last extremities rather than surrender to the king,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1713" id="Page_1713">Pg 1713</a></span>
the Rhodians were next introduced. The chief of their
embassy, after stating the commencement of their friendship
with the Roman people and merits of the Rhodians, first in
the war with Philip, and afterwards in that with Antiochus,
said: &#8220;Conscript fathers, there is nothing in the whole course
of our affairs that gives us more trouble and uneasiness than
that we should have a debate with Eumenes; with whom
alone, of all the kings in the world, each of us as individuals
has a private tie of hospitality, and, what weighs more with
us, our state has a public one. But, conscript fathers, it is not
our own inclinations that disunite us, but the nature of circumstances
which exercise an all-powerful influence, so that we,
being free ourselves, plead the cause of other men&#8217;s freedom;
while kings wish to have all things subservient and subject to
their command. Yet, be that as it may, our respect towards
the king is an obstacle to us, rather than that the debate is intricate,
or likely to give you perplexity in your deliberations.
For if no honour could be otherwise paid to the king, your
friend and ally, who has merited highly in this very war, and
concerning whose reward the consideration is, unless you
should deliver free states into his power, the deliberation
would be a difficult one, lest you should either send away a
king, your friend, without due honour, or depart from your
own institutions, and sully now, by the servitude of so
many states, the glory which you have acquired in the war
with Philip. But from this necessity of diminishing either
your gratitude towards your friend, or your own glory,
fortune completely frees you. For, through the bounty
of the gods, your victory is not more glorious than it is
rich, so that it can easily acquit you of that just as a debt.
Lycaonia, both the Phrygias, with Pisidia, the Chersonese,
and the adjoining parts of Europe, are all in your power; and
any one of these, given to the king, can double his dominions;
but if they were all conferred upon him, they would
set him on a level with the greatest of kings. You have it,
therefore, in your power to enrich your allies with the prizes
of the war; and, not to depart from your usual line of policy,
and to remember what motive you assigned as your cause of
war, formerly against Philip, latterly against Antiochus; what
you performed on the conquest of Philip; what is now desired
and expected from you, not so much because you have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1714" id="Page_1714">Pg 1714</a></span>
done it before, as because it becomes you to do it. For different
persons look on different circumstances as specious and
plausible motives for taking up arms. Some go to war to get
possession of land, some of villages, some of towns, some of
ports, and some of the sea-coast. Such things you never
coveted, when you had them not; and you cannot covet them
now, when the whole world is under your dominion. You ever
fought for your dignity and glory, in the sight of the whole
human race, which long since has learned to respect your name
and empire next to that of the immortal gods. And to procure
and acquire these was an arduous task. I know not whether
it may be more difficult to retain them. You have undertaken
to defend from the slavery of kings the liberty of a nation
the most ancient and most highly distinguished, both by the
fame of its exploits, and by universal praise for politeness and
learning; it becomes you to make this patronage of an entire
nation, received under your care and protection, perpetual.
The cities standing on the original soil, are not more Grecian
than their colonies, which formerly migrated thence into Asia;
nor has change of country changed either their race or manners.
Every state among us has ventured to contend in a
respectful contest, in every good quality and virtue, with its
parents and founders. Most of you have visited the cities in
Greece, and those in Asia. We are surpassed in no other
circumstance than that we are too far distant from you. We
hear that the inhabitants of Marseilles (who, if nature, implanted,
as it were, in their bosoms, could be overcome by
the genus of the soil, would ere this have been rendered
savage, by the many barbarous tribes surrounding them)
are deservedly held in as high honour and esteem by you as
if they were inhabitants of the very centre of Greece. For
they have preserved, not only the sound of the language, the
mode of dress, and the habit; but, above all, the manners,
the laws, and a mind pure and untainted by contagion from
their neighbours. The boundary of your empire, at present,
is Mount Taurus. Nothing within that line ought to be
thought remote. To whatever extent your arms have reached,
let justice, emanating from Rome, spread. Let barbarians, with
whom the commands of masters have always served instead
of laws, have kings, in which government they delight; the
Greeks endure their own fortune; they have a spirit like your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1715" id="Page_1715">Pg 1715</a></span>
own. They too, in former times, grasped at empire by their
internal strength. They now pray that empire may remain to
eternity where it is at present. They consider it sufficient that
their liberty should be defended by your arms, since they are
unable to protect it by their own. But it is objected, that
some of their states sided with Antiochus. So did others,
before, with Philip; so did the Tarentines with Pyrrhus. Not
to enumerate other nations, Carthage enjoys liberty and its
own laws. Consider, conscript fathers, how much you owe
to this example, set by yourselves. You will surely make
up your mind to refuse to the ambition of Eumenes, what
you refused to your own most just resentment. With what
brave and faithful exertions we, Rhodians, have assisted you,
both in this late war, and in all the wars that you have waged
in that part of the world, we leave to your own judgment.
We now, in peace, offer you such advice, that if you conform
to it, all the world will judge that you used your victory with
more honour to yourselves, than that with which you gained
it.&#8221; Their arguments seemed well adapted to the Roman
grandeur.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a55" name="a55"></a>55</span>
After the Rhodians, the ambassadors of Antiochus
were called. These, after the common practice of petitioners
for pardon, acknowledged the king&#8217;s error, and besought the
conscript fathers to deliberate, mindful rather of their own
mercy than of the misconduct of the king, who had suffered
enough and more than enough of punishment; in fine, to
ratify, by their authority, the peace granted by their general,
Lucius Scipio, with the conditions on which he had given it.
The senate voted, that the peace should be observed; and the
people, a few days after, ordered it. The treaty was concluded
in the Capitol with Antipater, chief of the embassy,
and son of the brother of king Antiochus. Then the other
embassies from Asia were heard, to all of whom was returned
the same answer, that &#8220;the senate, in conformity with the
usage of their ancestors, would send ten ambassadors to examine
and adjust the affairs of Asia. That the general plan
was to be this: that the places on this side of Mount Taurus,
which had been within the limits of the realm of Antiochus,
should be assigned to Eumenes, excepting Lycia and Caria,
as far as the river M&aelig;ander; and that these last-mentioned
should become the property of the Rhodians. That the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1716" id="Page_1716">Pg 1716</a></span>
states of Asia, which had been tributary to Attalus, should
likewise pay tribute to Eumenes; and such as had been tributary
to Antiochus, should be free and independent.&#8221; They
appointed ten ambassadors, Quintus Minucius Rufus, Lucius
Furius Purpureo, Quintus Minucius Thermus, Appius Claudius
Nero, Cneius Cornelius Merula, Marcus Junius Brutus,
Lucius Aurunculeius, Lucius &AElig;milius Paulus, Publius Cornelius
Lentulus, and Publius &AElig;lius Tubero.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a56" name="a56"></a>56</span>
To these full instructions were given to decide whatever
required an examination of the place. Concerning the
general plan the senate voted: that &#8220;all Lycaonia, both the
Phrygias, and Mysia, the royal forests, and Lydia, and Ionia,
excepting those towns which had been free on the day whereon
the battle was fought with Antiochus, and excepting by
name Magnesia at Sipylus; then the city of Caria, called
also Hydrela, and the territory of Hydrela, stretching towards
Phrygia, and the forts and villages on the river M&aelig;ander, and
likewise the towns, excepting such as had been free before
the war, and excepting by name, Telmissus, and the fort of
Telmissium, and the lands which had belonged to Ptolemy of
Telmissus; all these which are written above, were ordered
to be given to king Eumenes. Lycia was given to the Rhodians,
excepting the same Telmissus, and the fort of Telmissium,
with the lands which had belonged to Ptolemy of Telmissus;
these were withheld both from Eumenes and the
Rhodians. To the latter was given also that part of Caria
which lies beyond the river M&aelig;ander nearest to the island of
Rhodes, with its towns, villages, forts, and lands, extending
to Pisidia, excepting those towns which had been in a state
of freedom on the day before that of the battle with Antiochus.&#8221;
The Rhodians, after returning thanks for these
favours, mentioned the city of Soli in Cilicia, &#8220;the inhabitants
of which,&#8221; they said, &#8220;as well as themselves, derived
their origin from Argos; and, in consequence of this relation,
a brotherly affection subsisted between the two states. They,
therefore, requested the senate, as an extraordinary favour, to
exempt that city from subjection to the king.&#8221; The ambassadors
of Antiochus were called in, and the matter was proposed
to them, but their consent could not be obtained; Antipater
appealing to the treaty, in opposition to which, not only
Soli, but Cilicia was sought by the Rhodians, and they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1717" id="Page_1717">Pg 1717</a></span>
passing the summits of Taurus. The Rhodians being summoned
again before the senate, the fathers, after they had stated
how earnestly the king&#8217;s ambassador opposed the measure,
added that &#8220;if the Rhodians were of opinion that the affair
particularly affected the dignity of their state, the senate
would try by all means to overcome the obstinacy of the ambassadors.&#8221;
Hereupon the Rhodians, with greater warmth
than before, returned thanks, and declared, that they would
rather give way to the arrogance of Antipater, than afford
any reason for disturbing the peace. So no change was made
with respect to Soli.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a57" name="a57"></a>57</span>
During the time in which these things were transacted,
deputies from Marseilles announced that Lucius B&aelig;bius, the
pr&aelig;tor, on his way into his province of Spain, had been surrounded
by the Ligurians; that a great part of his retinue
being slain, he himself, wounded, had made his escape, without
his lictors, and with but few attendants, to Marseilles, and
in three days after expired. The senate, on hearing of this
misfortune, decreed, that Publius Junius Brutus, who was the
propr&aelig;tor in Etruria, having delivered the province and army
to whichsoever of the lieutenants he should think proper,
should go himself into Farther Spain, which was to be his
province. This decree of the senate and a letter was sent by
the pr&aelig;tor, Spurius Posthumius, into Etruria; and Publius
Junius, the propr&aelig;tor, set out for Spain, in which province,
long before a successor could arrive, Lucius &AElig;milius Paulus,
who afterwards with great glory conquered king Perseus,
though he had carried on matters unsuccessfully the year before,
having raised an army by a hasty levy, fought a
pitched battle with the Lusitanians. The enemy were routed,
and put to flight; eighteen thousand were killed, three thousand
three hundred taken, and their camp stormed. The
fame of this victory made matters more tranquil in Spain.
In the same year, on the third day before the calends of
January, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, Marcus Atilius Serranus,
and Lucius Valerius Tappo, triumvirs, settled a Latin colony
at Bononia, according to a decree of the senate. Three thousand
men were led to that place. Seventy acres were given
to each horseman, fifty to each of the other colonists. The
land had been taken from the Boian Gauls, who had formerly
expelled the Tuscans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1718" id="Page_1718">Pg 1718</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a58" name="a58"></a>58</span>
In the same year, many distinguished men strove
for the censorship; and this business, as if it furnished in
itself insufficient grounds for dispute, gave rise to another
contest of a much more violent nature. The candidates were,
Titus Quintius Flamininus, Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of
Cneius, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, Marcus Porcius Cato, Marcus
Claudius Marcellus, and Manius Acilius Glabrio, who had
defeated Antiochus and the &AElig;tolians at Thermopyl&aelig;. The
favour of the people inclined to the last in particular, because
he had given many largesses, by which he had bound a great
number of men to him. When so many nobles could ill brook
that a man of no family should be so much preferred to them,
Publius Sempronius Gracchus and Caius Sempronius Rutilus,
tribunes of the people, commenced a prosecution against him,
on a charge, that he had neither exhibited in his triumph, nor
lodged in the treasury, a large part of the royal treasure, and of
the booty taken in the camp of Antiochus. The depositions of
the lieutenants-general and military tribunes were at variance.
Beyond all the other witnesses, Marcus Cato was remarkable,
whose authority, acquired by the uniform tenor of his life, the
fact of his being a candidate diminished. He, when a witness,
affirmed, that he had not observed, in the triumph, the gold and
silver vessels which, on the taking of the camp, he had seen
among the other spoils of the king. At last Glabrio declared,
that he declined the election, chiefly to throw odium on
Cato; since he, a candidate of an origin as humble as his own,
by an abominable perjury, attacked that which men of noble
birth bore with silent indignation. A fine of one hundred
thousand <i>asses</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> was proposed to the people against him.
Twice there was a contest on the subject. On the third
hearing, as the accused had declined the election, and the
people were unwilling to vote about the fine, the tribunes
also dropped the business. The censors elected were, Titus
Quintius Flamininus and Marcus Claudius Marcellus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a59" name="a59"></a>59</span>
At the same time, when an audience of the senate, in
the temple of Apollo outside the city, was granted to Lucius
&AElig;milius Regillus, who, with the fleet, had defeated the admiral
of king Antiochus; after hearing the recital of his services,
with what great fleets of the enemy he had engaged,
how many of their ships he had sunk or taken, a naval triumph
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1719" id="Page_1719">Pg 1719</a></span>
was voted him by the unanimous consent of the fathers.
He triumphed on the calends of February. In this procession
were carried forty-nine golden crowns; the quantity of
money was by no means so great considering the appearance of
the triumph over the king, being only thirty-four thousand seven
hundred Attic tetradrachms,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and one hundred and thirty-two
thousand three hundred cistophoruses.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Supplications were
then performed, by order of the senate, in consideration of the
successful services to the state, achieved in Spain by Lucius
&AElig;milius Paulus. Not long after, Lucius Scipio arrived in
the city; and, that he might not be inferior to his brother in
point of a surname, he chose to be called Asiaticus. He spoke
largely of his services both before the senate and a general
assembly. There were some who judged that the war was
greater by fame than by real difficulty; for it was terminated
entirely by one memorable engagement; and that the glory
of that victory had been stripped of its bloom at Thermopyl&aelig;.
But, to any person judging impartially, it must appear, that
the light at Thermopyl&aelig; was with the &AElig;tolians, rather than
with the king. For with how small a portion of his own
strength did Antiochus engage in that battle! whereas, in
the other, in Asia, the strength of the whole Asiatic continent
stood combined; for he had collected auxiliaries of all
nations from the most remote quarters of the east. Justly, therefore,
were the greatest possible honours paid to the immortal
gods, for having rendered a most important victory easy in
the acquisition; and a triumph was decreed to the commander.
He triumphed in the intercalary month, the day
before the calends of March; which triumph was greater in
the display to the eye than that of Africanus his brother, yet
if we recall to our memory the circumstances, and estimate
the dangers and difficulty, it was no more to be compared
to it, than if you would contrast one general with the
other, Antiochus with Hannibal. He carried, in his triumph,
military standards, two hundred and thirty-four; models of
towns, one hundred and thirty-four; elephants&#8217; teeth, one
thousand two hundred and thirty; crowns of gold, two hundred
and twenty-four: pounds-weight of silver, one hundred
and thirty-seven thousand four hundred and twenty; Attic
tetradrachms, two hundred and twenty-four thousand;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> cistophoruses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1720" id="Page_1720">Pg 1720</a></span>
three hundred and thirty-one thousand and seventy;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
gold pieces, called Philippians, one hundred and forty thousand;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
silver vases, all engraved, to the amount of one thousand
four hundred and twenty-four pounds&#8217; weight; of golden
vases, one thousand and twenty-four pounds&#8217; weight; and of
the king&#8217;s generals, governors, and officers at court, thirty-two
were led before his chariot. Twenty-five denariuses<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> were
given to each of his soldiers, double that sum to a centurion,
triple it to a horseman; and after the triumph, their pay and
allowance of corn were doubled. He had already doubled
them after the battle in Asia. He triumphed about a year after
the expiration of his consulship.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="a60" name="a60"></a>60</span>
Cneius Manlius, the consul, arrived in Asia, and Quintus
Fabius Labeo, the pr&aelig;tor, reached the fleet, nearly at the same
time. The consul did not want reasons for war against the
Gauls; the sea was subjected to the Romans since the conquest
of Antiochus. It appeared best to Quintus Fabius, considering
to what thing in particular he should apply himself, lest he might
seem to have had a province in which there was no employment,
to sail over to the island of Crete. The Cydonians were
engaged in war against the Gortynians and Gnossians; and a
great number of Roman and Italian captives were said to be
in slavery in different parts of the island. Having sailed with
the fleet from Ephesus, as soon as he touched the shore of
Crete, he despatched orders to all the states to cease from
hostilities, and to search each of them for the captives in its
own cities and territory, and bring them to him; also, to send
ambassadors to him, to treat of matters belonging alike to the
Romans and Cretans. These orders had little influence on the
Cretans. Excepting the Gortynians, none of them restored the
captives. Valerius Antias relates, that as many as four thousand
captives were restored out of the whole island, because
the Cretans feared his threats of war; and that this was deemed
a sufficient reason for Fabius obtaining from the senate a
naval triumph, although he performed no other exploit. From
Crete Fabius returned to Ephesus: having despatched three
ships from the latter place to the coast of Thrace, he ordered
the garrisons of Antiochus to be withdrawn from &AElig;nos and
Maronea, that these cities might be left at liberty.</p>

<h2><a name="bk38" id="bk38"></a>BOOK XXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Marcus Fulvius the consul besieged Ambracia, in Epirus, and received its
surrender; he reduced Cephallenia, and granted peace to the &AElig;tolians,
on their complete subjection. Cneius Manlius the consul, his colleague,
conquered the Gallogr&aelig;cians, including the Tolistoboii, Tectosagi, and
Trocmi who, under the command of Brennus, had crossed over into
Asia, since they were the only refractory nation on this side of Mount
Taurus. Their origin is related, and likewise the manner in which they
became masters of the territories which they now hold. An instance, also,
of virtue and chastity in a woman is recorded: for when the wife of
Ortiagon, king of the Gallogr&aelig;cians, was a captive, she slew a centurion
who was sentinel over her, because he offered her violence. The lustrum
was closed by the censors. Two hundred and fifty-eight thousand three
hundred and twenty-eight citizens were rated. A treaty of amity was
entered into with Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia. Cneius Manlius,
although the ten ambassadors by whose advice he had written the terms
of the treaty with Antiochus, opposed him, pleaded his cause in person
in the senate, and triumphed over the Gallogr&aelig;cians. Scipio Africanus,
a day of trial being appointed him, as some say, by Quintus Petillius,
tribune of the people, as others say, by N&aelig;vius, on the charge of having
fraudulently deprived the treasury of the plunder taken from Antiochus,
when the day of trial came on, was summoned to the rostrum, and said,
&#8220;On this day, Romans, I conquered Carthage;&#8221; and, followed by the
people, ascended the Capitol. Subsequently, that he might not receive
any further annoyance front the injuries done him by the tribunes, he
retired into voluntary exile at Liternum: it is uncertain whether he
died there or at Rome, for monuments were erected to his memory in
both places. Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, brother of Africanus, was accused
and condemned on the same charge of embezzlement as his brother: when
he was being led to prison, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, tribune of the
commons, who had been previously on unfriendly terms with the Scipios,
vetoed it; and in return for that kindness, received in marriage the
daughter of Africanus. When the qu&aelig;stors were sent to take public possession
of the property of Lucius Scipio, not only was no trace of the king&#8217;s
money apparent in it, but not even so much was raised thereby as the
amount in which he was fined. He would not receive the countless sum
collected by his relations and friends: the mere necessaries of life were
purchased back.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b1" name="b1"></a>1</span>
While the war is being carried on in Asia, matters
were not even then tranquil among the &AElig;tolians, a commencement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1722" id="Page_1722">Pg 1722</a></span>
of these disturbances having originated with the
nation of the Athamanians. At that period, since the expulsion
of Amynander, Athamania was kept in subjection by royal
garrisons, under governors appointed by Philip, who by their
haughty and overbearing exercise of power, had made the people
regret the loss of Amynander. The hope of recovering the
kingdom was presented to Amynander, then an exile in &AElig;tolia,
by the letters of his partisans, who informed him of the state of
Athamania: and messengers were sent to Argithea, (for that
was the chief city of Athamania,) to inform the principal men,
that, if they were sufficiently assured of the inclinations of their
countrymen, he, having obtained succours from the &AElig;tolians,
would come, into Athamania with a chosen body of &AElig;tolians,
who constituted the council of that nation, and their pr&aelig;tor,
Nicander. And, when he found that they were prepared for
every thing, he gave them notice, immediately after, of the day
on which he would enter Athamania at the head of an army.
At first there were four conspirators against the Macedonian
garrison; then each of these took as associates six assistants
for the execution of the business; but, afterwards, distrusting
their small number, which was rather calculated for
the concealment than for the execution of the design, they
took in a number of associates, equal to the former. Being
thus increased to fifty-two, they divided themselves into four
parties, one of which repaired to Heraclea, another to Tetraphylia,
where the royal treasure used to be kept, a third to
Theudoria, and the fourth to Argithea. It was agreed that
they should at first appear in the forum publicly, without any
bustle, as if they had come about their own ordinary concerns;
and then, on a certain day, raise the whole populace, so as to
dislodge the Macedonian garrisons from the citadels. When
the day came, and Amynander with a thousand &AElig;tolians was
on the frontiers, by the preconcerted plan the Macedonian
garrisons were driven from the four places at once, and letters
were despatched to all the other cities, calling on them to rescue
themselves from the exorbitant tyranny of Philip, and to
reinstate their hereditary and lawful prince. Accordingly,
the Macedonians were, every where, expelled. The town of
Theium, (in consequence of the letters being intercepted by
Teno, commander of the garrison, and owing to the citadel
being occupied by the king&#8217;s troops,) stood a siege of a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1723" id="Page_1723">Pg 1723</a></span>
days, and then surrendered to Amynander, who had now all
Athamania in his power, except the fort of Athen&aelig;um, on
the borders of Macedonia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b2" name="b2"></a>2</span>
When Philip heard of the defection of Athamania, he
out at the head of six thousand men, and proceeded, with
the utmost speed, to Gomphi. Having left the greater part
of his force, as they would not have been equal to such long
marches, he went forward, with two thousand, to Athen&aelig;um,
the only place which had been retained by his troops. Then,
having made attempts on the nearest places, when he clearly
perceived that all the rest of the country was hostile to him,
he retreated to Gomphi, and returned with the whole of his
army into Athamania. He then sent Zeno, at the head of
one thousand foot, with orders to seize on Ethopia, which
stands advantageously for commanding Argithea; and, as
soon as he understood that this post was in possession of his
party, he himself encamped near the temple of Acr&aelig;an Jupiter.
Here he was detained one whole day, by a tremendous
storm; and on the next, proceeded to lead them towards Argithea.
On the troops commencing their march the Athamanians
immediately appeared hastening to the hills which
overlooked the road. On the sight of whom, the foremost
battalions halted, while fear and confusion spread through the
whole army, and every one began to consider what might have
been the consequence, if the troops had gone down into the valleys
commanded by those cliffs. This confusion compelled the
king, who wished, if his men would follow him, to push on
rapidly through the defile, to call back the foremost, and return
by the same road by which he came. The Athamanians
at first followed at a distance, without making any attempt:
after the &AElig;tolians joined them, they left these to harass
the rear, and extended themselves on both flanks. Some of
them, by taking a shorter way, through known paths, seized
the passes; and such terror was struck into the Macedonians,
that they repassed the river in a manner more like a hasty
flight than a regular march, leaving behind many of their men
and arms. Here was the end of the pursuit, and the Macedonians,
in safety, returned to Gomphi, and from Gomphi into
Macedonia. The Athamanians and &AElig;tolians ran together,
from all sides, to Ethopia, to crush Zeno and his thousand
Macedonians. The Macedonians, distrusting their position,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1724" id="Page_1724">Pg 1724</a></span>
removed from Ethopia, to a hill which was higher and steeper
on all sides; from which the Athamanians, having found access
in several places, dislodged them; and while they were
dispersed, and unable to find the road for flight, through impassable
and unknown rocks, slew part of them and made part
prisoners. Great numbers, in their panic, tumbled down the
precipices; very few, with Zeno, effected their escape to the
king. Afterwards, permission to bury their dead was given
to them during the truce.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b3" name="b3"></a>3</span>
Amynander, on recovering possession of his kingdom,
sent ambassadors, both to the senate at Rome and to the
Scipios in Asia, who, since the grand battle with Antiochus,
stayed at Ephesus. He requested a treaty of amity, and apologized
for having had recourse to the &AElig;tolians, for the
recovery of his hereditary dominions. He made many charges
against Philip. The &AElig;tolians from Athamania proceeded
into Amphilochia, and, with the consent of the greater part of
the inhabitants, reduced that nation under their power and
dominion. After the recovery of Amphilochia, for it had
formerly belonged to the &AElig;tolians, they passed on, with hopes
of equal success, into Aperantia. That also, for the most
part, surrendered to the &AElig;tolians without a contest. The
Dolopians had never been subject to the &AElig;tolians, but
they were to Philip. These, at first, ran to arms; but when
they were informed of the Amphilochians taking part with
the &AElig;tolians, of Philip&#8217;s flight from Athamania, and the
destruction of his detachment, they also revolted from Philip
to the &AElig;tolians. Whilst the &AElig;tolians believed that they
were now secured against the Macedonians on all sides, by
these nations surrounding them, the report is brought to them
that Antiochus was conquered in Asia by the Romans. Not
very long after, their ambassadors came home from Rome,
without the prospect of peace, announcing that the consul
Fulvius, with his army, had already crossed the sea. Dismayed
at these accounts, they send the chief men of the state
to Rome to try the last hope, having previously solicited embassies
from Rhodes and Athens, that, through the influence
of those states, their petitions, lately rejected, might meet
with a more favourable reception from the senate: they took
no kind of precaution to avert the war, before it was almost
within sight. Marcus Fulvius, having brought over his army
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1725" id="Page_1725">Pg 1725</a></span>
to Apollonia, was, at this time, consulting with the Epirot
chiefs where he should commence his operations. It was the
opinion of the Epirots that he should attack Ambracia, which
had lately united itself to &AElig;tolia; alleging, that, &#8220;in case
the &AElig;tolians should come to its relief, there were open
plains around it, to fight in; or that if they should avoid a
battle there would be no great difficulty in the siege, for
there were at hand abundant materials for raising mounds and
other works, while the Arachthus, a navigable river, well
adapted to convey every thing requisite, flowed by the walls;
besides, the summer was just approaching, the fittest season
for the enterprise.&#8221; By these arguments they persuaded him
to march on through Epirus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b4" name="b4"></a>4</span>
To the consul, on his arrival at Ambracia, the siege
appeared to be a work of no small difficulty. Ambracia
stands at the foot of a rocky hill, called by the natives Perranthe:
the city, where the wall faces the plain and the river,
looks towards the west; the citadel, which is seated on the
hill, towards the east. The river Arachthus, which rises in
Athamania, falls here into a gulf of the sea, called the Ambracian,
from the name of the adjacent city. Besides that the
river defended it on one side and the hills on the other, it was
also surrounded by a strong wall, extending in circuit somewhat
more than three miles. Fulvius formed two camps at a
short distance from each other, and one fort on the high
ground opposite to the citadel; all which he intended to join
together by a rampart and trench, in such a manner that there
should be no exit from the city for the besieged, nor entrance
For the introduction of assistance from without. The &AElig;tolians,
on the report of the siege of Ambracia, were by this
time assembled at Stratus, in obedience to an edict of their
pr&aelig;tor, Nicander. At first they intended to have marched
hence, with their whole force, to raise the siege; afterwards,
when they heard that the place was already, in a great
measure, surrounded with works, and that the Epirots were
encamped on level ground, on the other side of the river, they
resolved to divide their forces. Eupolemus, with one thousand
light troops, marching to Ambracia, made his way into
the city, though the works were joined to each other. Nicander&#8217;s
first plan was to have attacked the camp of the
Epirots in the night, with the rest of the troops, as assistance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1726" id="Page_1726">Pg 1726</a></span>
could not be easily received from the Romans, because the
river ran between them. Afterward, judging it too dangerous
an undertaking, lest the Romans should by any means discover
it, and his retreat become unsafe, he was deterred from
this design, and marched away to ravage the country of
Acarnania.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b5" name="b5"></a>5</span>
The consul having now finished the intrenchments with
which it was necessary to surround the city, and likewise the
works which he was preparing to bring forward to the walls,
attacked the city in five different places; three attacks, at equal
distances from each other, he directed against the quarter which
they called Pyrrheum, as the approach was easier from the
plain; one opposite to the temple of &AElig;sculapius, and one against
the citadel. He broke down the walls with battering-rams, and
tore down the battlements with poles armed with scythes. At
first, terror and dismay seized the townsmen, at the formidable
appearance of the works, and the shocks given to the walls,
which were attended with a dreadful noise: afterwards, when
they beheld them contrary to their hopes standing, having again
resumed courage, they, by means of cranes, threw down upon
the battering-rams weighty masses of lead, or stone, or beams
of timber; dragging the armed poles, with iron grapples, within
the walls, they broke off the hooks; besides, by sallies, both
by night against the watch-guards of the engines, and by
day against the advanced posts, they kept the besiegers in a
state of continual alarm. While affairs at Ambracia were in
this state, the &AElig;tolians had returned from ravaging Acarnania,
to Stratus. Their pr&aelig;tor, Nicander, having conceived
hopes of raising the siege by a bold effort, sent a person
called Nicodamus, with five hundred &AElig;tolians, into Ambracia,
and appointed a certain night, and even the time of
the night, on which, from within the city, they were to
assault the works of the enemy, opposite to the Pyrrheum,
while he himself should alarm the Roman camp. He supposed
that, in consequence of the alarm on both sides, and night increasing
the terror, something memorable might be achieved.
And Nicodamus, in the dead of the night, (when he had
escaped the notice of some of the parties on watch, and broken
through others by his determined onset,) having passed the
intrenchment, penetrated into the city; and gave the besieged
considerable hope and courage for any enterprise; and as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1727" id="Page_1727">Pg 1727</a></span>
soon as the appointed time arrived, according to the plan preconcerted,
he made a sudden assault on the works. This undertaking was
more formidable in the attempt than in the effect,
because no attack was made from without; for the pr&aelig;tor of
the &AElig;tolians had either been deterred by fear, or had judged it
more advisable to carry succours to Amphilochia, which had
been lately reduced; which Perseus, the son of Philip, who
was sent to recover Dolopia and Amphilochia, was besieging
with the greatest vigour.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b6" name="b6"></a>6</span>
The works of the Romans against the Pyrrheum were
carried on in three different places, as has been mentioned
before, all which works the &AElig;tolians assaulted at once, but not
with similar weapons or similar force. Some advanced with
burning torches, others carrying tow and pitch, and fire-darts,
their entire line being illuminated by the blaze. At the first
assault they cut off many of the men on guard. Afterwards,
when the shout and uproar reached the camp, and the signal
was given by the consul, the troops took arms and poured out
of all the gates to succour their friends. In one place the
contest was carried on with fire and sword; from the other
two, the &AElig;tolians retired with disappointment, after essaying
rather than supporting a fight. The whole brunt of the battle
fell on the one quarter with great fury. Here the two commanders,
Eupolemus and Nicodamus, in their different posts,
encouraged their men and animated them with hope amounting
almost to certainty, that Nicander would, according to his
agreement, come up speedily and attack the enemy&#8217;s rear.
This expectation for some time supported their courage in
the fight. But at last, as they did not receive the concerted
signal from their friends, and saw the number of their enemies
continually increasing, they pressed on with less energy, as if
deserted; finally, having abandoned the attempt, their retreat
now becoming almost impracticable, they were driven in flight
into the city, after having burned a part of the works, however,
and killed a much greater number than they lost themselves.
If the affair had been conducted according to the plan
concerted, there was no reason to doubt but that one part at
least of the works might have been stormed with great havoc
of the Romans;. The Ambracians and the &AElig;tolians, who
were within, not only renounced the enterprise of that night,
but supposing themselves betrayed by their friends, became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1728" id="Page_1728">Pg 1728</a></span>
much less spirited. None of them any longer sallied out, as
before, against the enemy&#8217;s stations, but posted on the walls
and towers, fought without danger.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b7" name="b7"></a>7</span>
Perseus, on hearing of the approach of the &AElig;tolians,
having raised the siege of the city in which he was employed,
and having ravaged the country, quitted Amphilochia, and
returned into Macedon. The devastation of their sea-coast
called away the &AElig;tolians from this region. Pleuratus, king
of the Illyrians, entered the Corinthian gulf with sixty barks,
and having formed a junction with the ships of the Ach&aelig;ans
lying at Patr&aelig;, wasted the maritime parts of &AElig;tolia. Against
these one thousand &AElig;tolians were sent, who, by taking short
routes, met the fleet wherever it, while sailing around the indentations
of the coast, attempted a landing. The Romans at
Ambracia, by the battering of their rams in many places at once,
laid open a great part of the city; but nevertheless were unable
to penetrate into the heart of it. For instead of the wall knocked
down a new one was raised with proportionate speed, while the
armed men standing on the ruins, formed a kind of bulwark.
The consul, therefore, when he made no progress by open force,
resolved to form a secret mine, covering the ground first with
his machines. And for a long time his workmen, though
employed both night and day, not only in digging under the
ground but also in carrying away the earth, escaped the
observation of the enemy. A heap of it, however, rising
suddenly, gave the townsmen intimation of their work, and
terrified lest, the wall being undermined, a passage should be
opened into the city, they determined to draw a trench within,
opposite to the work that was covered with machines. In
which when they reached such a depth as the bottom of the
mine could well be, then keeping profound silence, having
applied their ears to several different places, they endeavoured
to catch the sound of the miners; which being heard, they
opened a way directly towards them. Nor did it require
much exertion, for they came in a short time to an open space
where the wall was supported with props by the enemy. The
works joining here, as the passage was open from the trench
to the mine, the parties began to fight in the dark under
ground, first of all with the tools which they had used in the
works, but afterwards armed men came quickly up. Subsequently
the contest became less spirited; as the besieged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1729" id="Page_1729">Pg 1729</a></span>
stopped the passage, sometimes by stretching strong hair-cloths
across it, sometimes by hastily placing doors in the
way of their antagonists. A new engine, requiring no great
labour, was invented against those who were in the mine.
The besieged bored a hole in the bottom of a cask, by which a
moderate-sized pipe could be inserted, and made an iron pipe
and iron head for the cask, which was perforated in many
places. They placed this cask, filled with small feathers, with
its mouth turned towards the mine. Through, the holes in the
head of the cask projected those very long spears, which they
call sarissas, to keep off the enemy. They kindled a small spark
of fire, placed among the feathers, by blowing with a smith&#8217;s
bellows, inserted into the end of the pipe. After that the
smoke arising from this, not only in great quantities, but also
more offensive from the nauseous stench proceeding from the
burnt feathers, had filled the mine, scarcely any one could stay
within.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b8" name="b8"></a>8</span>
Whilst affairs at Ambracia were in this state, Ph&aelig;neas
and Damoteles came to the consul, as ambassadors from the
&AElig;tolians, invested with full powers by a decree of the
general assembly of that nation. For when their pr&aelig;tor saw
on one side Ambracia besieged; on another, the sea-coast
infested by the enemy&#8217;s ships; on a third, Amphilochia and
Dolopia ravaged by the Macedonians, and that the &AElig;tolians
were incapable of meeting the three enemies at once, having
summoned a council, he consulted the chiefs on what was to be
done. The opinions of all tended to one point: &#8220;that peace
should be solicited on equal terms if possible; if not, on any
terms that could be borne. That the war was undertaken in
reliance on Antiochus. Since Antiochus was vanquished by
land and sea, and driven beyond the mountains of Taurus,
almost out of the world, what hope remained of their being
able to support it? That Ph&aelig;neas and Damoteles, since the
emergency was so great, should do whatever they might judge
to tend to the interest of the &AElig;tolians and their own honour.
For what counsel, what option had been left them by fortune?&#8221;
Ambassadors were despatched with instructions,
to beseech the consul to &#8220;have mercy on the city, and to
take compassion on a nation once acknowledged as an ally;
and driven to madness, they would not say by ill treatment,
but undoubtedly by their sufferings.&#8221; That the &AElig;tolians &#8220;had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1730" id="Page_1730">Pg 1730</a></span>
not in Antiochus&#8217; war deserved a larger share of punishment
than they had of reward in that against Philip. That neither
then was compensation liberally made them, nor ought punishment
now to be inflicted on them in an immoderate degree.&#8221;
To this the consul answered, that &#8220;the &AElig;tolians had sued for
peace often, rather than ever with sincere intentions. Let
them in soliciting peace imitate Antiochus, whom they had
drawn into the war. He had ceded, not the few cities whose
liberty was the ground of the dispute, but an opulent kingdom,
all Asia on this side Mount Taurus. That he (the consul)
would not listen to the &AElig;tolians, treating concerning peace,
unless they laid down their arms. That, in the first place,
their arms and all their horses must be delivered up; and in
the next place, one thousand talents<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of silver must be paid to
the Roman people; half of which sum must be laid down immediately,
if they wished for peace. To these articles he
would add when concluding the treaty, that they must have the
same allies and the same enemies as the Roman people.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b9" name="b9"></a>9</span>
To which demands the ambassadors having made no
reply, both because they were severe, and because they knew
the spirit of their country to be unbroken and changeable,
returned home, that they might again and again, while the
thing was undecided, consult the pr&aelig;tor and chiefs as to what
was to be done. They were received with clamour and reproaches,
and were asked &#8220;how long would they protract the
matter, though commanded to bring with them a peace of some
kind or other?&#8221; But as they were going back to Ambracia,
they were caught in an ambuscade, laid near the road by the
Acarnanians, with whom they were at war, and carried to Thyrium
to be confined. The delay arising from this incident interrupted
the negotiations. When the ambassadors of the Athenians
and Rhodians, who had come to intercede for them, were
now with the consul, Amynander also, king of Athamania, having
obtained a safe-conduct, had come into the Roman camp,
being more concerned for the city of Ambracia, where he had
spent the greatest part of his exile, than for the nation of the
&AElig;tolians. When the consul was informed by them of the
accident which had befallen the ambassadors, he ordered them
to be brought from Thyrium; and on their arrival they began
to treat concerning peace. Amynander, as that was his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1731" id="Page_1731">Pg 1731</a></span>
principal object, laboured assiduously to persuade the Ambracians
to capitulate. When he made but little progress in this,
while he was coming under the walls and conferring with their
chiefs, he at last, with the consul&#8217;s permission, went into the
city; where, partly by arguments, partly by entreaties, he prevailed
on them to surrender themselves to the Romans. Caius
Valerius, the son of L&aelig;vinus, who was the first that had made
a treaty of alliance with that nation, the brother of the consul,
born of the same mother, eminently aided the &AElig;tolians. The
Ambracians, having first stipulated that they might send away
the auxiliary &AElig;tolians in safety, opened their gates. Then
the &AElig;tolians stipulated that &#8220;they should pay five hundred
Euboic talents,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> two hundred of this sum at present, and three
hundred at six equal annual payments; that they should
deliver up to the Romans the prisoners and deserters; that
they should not subject any city to their jurisdiction, which,
since the first coming of Titus Quintius into Greece, had
either been taken by the arms of the Romans, or voluntarily
entered into alliance with them: and that the island of
Cephallenia should be excluded from the treaty.&#8221; Although
these terms were more moderate than they themselves had
expected, yet the &AElig;tolians begged permission to lay them
before the council, which request was granted. A short discussion
about the cities engaged the council. Since they had
been for some time under their laws, they bore with pain that
they should be torn off, as it were, from their body. However,
they unanimously voted that the terms of peace should
be accepted. The Ambracians presented the consul with a
golden crown of one hundred and fifty pounds&#8217; weight. The
brazen and marble statues and paintings, with which Ambracia
was more richly decorated than any other city in that
country, since it was the royal residence of Pyrrhus, were.
all removed and carried away; but nothing else was injured
or even touched.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b10" name="b10"></a>10</span>
The consul, marching into the interior parts of &AElig;tolia,
encamped at Amphilochian Argos, twenty-two miles from Ambracia.
Here, at length, the &AElig;tolian ambassadors arrived, the
consul in the mean time wondered at the cause of their delay.
Then, after he heard that the council of the &AElig;tolians had approved
of the terms of peace, having ordered them to go to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1732" id="Page_1732">Pg 1732</a></span>
Rome to the senate, and having permitted the Athenian and
Rhodian mediators to go with them, and appointed his brother,
Caius Valerius, to accompany them, he himself passed over to
Cephallenia. The ambassadors found the ears and minds of all
the principal people at Rome prepossessed by charges made
against them by Philip, who, by complaining both by ambassadors
and by letters, that Dolopia, Amphilochia, and Athamania
had been forcibly taken from him, that his garrison, and at last
even his son Perseus, had been driven out of Amphilochia, had
turned away the senate from their entreaties. The Athenians
and Rhodians were, nevertheless, heard with attention. An
Athenian ambassador, Leon, son of Icesias, is said to have even
affected them much by his eloquence. Making use of a common
simile, and comparing the multitude of the &AElig;tolians to a
calm sea, when it comes to be ruffled by the winds, he said,
that &#8220;as long as they faithfully adhered to the alliance with
Rome, they rested in the calm state natural to nations; but
that when Thoas and Dic&aelig;archus began to blow from Asia,
Menetas and Damocrites from Europe, then was raised that
storm which dashed them on Antiochus as on a rock.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b11" name="b11"></a>11</span>
The &AElig;tolians, after being a long time buffeted about,
at length prevailed to have articles of peace concluded. They
were these:&mdash;&#8220;Let the &AElig;tolian nation, without fraud or
deceit, maintain the empire and majesty of the Roman people;
let them not suffer to pass through their territories, nor,
in any manner whatever, aid or assist any army that shall
march against the allies and friends of the Romans; let them
have the same enemies as the Roman people; let them bear
arms against them, and take a share in their wars; let them
deliver up the deserters, fugitives, and prisoners, to the
Romans and their allies, excepting such as were prisoners
before, who having returned home, were afterwards captured;
and also such as, at the time of their being taken,
were enemies to Rome, while the &AElig;tolians were in the Roman
army. Let such of the others as can be found be delivered up.
without reserve, to the magistrates of Corcyra, within one
hundred days; and such as cannot now be found, as soon as
they shall be discovered. Let them give forty hostages at the
discretion of the Roman consul, none younger than twelve
years nor older than forty; let neither the pr&aelig;tor, nor the
general of the horse, nor the public secretary, be a hostage;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1733" id="Page_1733">Pg 1733</a></span>
nor any person who has before been a hostage in the hands of
the Romans. Let Cephallenia be excluded from these articles.&#8221;
With respect to the sum of money which they were to pay, and
the mode of payment, no alteration was made in the arrangement
which had been made by the consul. If they chose to give
gold instead of silver, it was agreed that they might do so,
provided that one piece of gold should be deemed equivalent to
ten of silver of the same weight. &#8220;Whatever cities, whatever
lands, whatever men have been formerly under the jurisdiction
of the &AElig;tolians, and have, either in the consulate of Titus Quintius
and Publius &AElig;lius, or since their consulate, been subdued
by the arms of the Roman people, or have made a voluntary
submission to them, the &AElig;tolians are not to reclaim. The
&#338;nians, with their city and lands, are to belong to the Acarnanians.&#8221;
On these conditions was the treaty concluded with
the &AElig;tolians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b12" name="b12"></a>12</span>
Not only in the same summer, but almost at the very
time in which these acts were performed by Marcus Fulvius
the consul in &AElig;tolia, the other consul, Cneius Manlius, carried
on war in Gallogr&aelig;cia; the progress of which I shall now
relate. In the beginning of spring the consul came to Ephesus,
and having received the command of the army from Lucius
Scipio, and reviewed the troops, he made an harangue
to the soldiers; in which, having praised their bravery in
having completely conquered Antiochus in a single battle, he
encouraged them to undertake a new war against the Gauls,
who had supported Antiochus with auxiliaries, and were,
besides, of such untractable tempers, that Antiochus was
to no purpose removed beyond the range of Mount Taurus,
unless the power of the Gauls was broken; he then spoke
briefly of himself, in terms neither ill-grounded nor extravagant.
The delighted soldiers heard the consul with frequent
bursts of applause, considering the Gauls as having been a
part of the strength of Antiochus; and that, since that king
had been vanquished, there would be no power in the forces
of the Gauls, by themselves. The consul judged that Eumenes
was absent at an unseasonable time, (he was then at Rome,) as
he was well acquainted with the nature of the country and
of the inhabitants, and as it was his interest that the power of
the Gauls should be broken. He therefore sends for his
brother Attalus, from Pergamus, and having exhorted him to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1734" id="Page_1734">Pg 1734</a></span>
undertake the war in conjunction with him, he sends him,
away to make preparations, after promising his own exertions
and those of his countrymen. A few days after, Attalus with
one thousand foot and two hundred horse, having ordered his
brother Athen&aelig;us to follow with the rest of the troops, and
committed the care of Pergamus to persons whom he knew to
be faithful to his brother and to his government, met the consul,
who had marched from Ephesus to Magnesia. The consul,
after highly commending the young prince, having advanced
with all his forces, encamped on the bank of the M&aelig;ander, for
as that river could not be forded, it was necessary to collect
shipping for carrying over the army.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b13" name="b13"></a>13</span>
Having passed the M&aelig;ander, they came to Hiera
Come.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> In this place there is a magnificent temple, and
oracle of Apollo; the priests are said to deliver their responses
in verses by no means inelegant. Hence, in two days&#8217; march
they reached the river Harpasus; whither came ambassadors
from Alaband&aelig;, entreating the consul, either by his authority
or his arms, to compel a fort, which had lately revolted from
it, to return to its former allegiance. To the same place came
Athen&aelig;us the brother of Eumenes, and Attalus, with Leusus,
a Cretan, and Corragos, a Macedonian commander. They
brought with them one thousand foot and three hundred horse,
composed of various nations. The consul, having sent a military
tribune with a small party, took the fort by assault, and
restored it to the Alabandians. He himself, not deviating from
his route, pitched his camp at Antioch on the M&aelig;ander. The
source of this river is in Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, which city was formerly
the metropolis of Phrygia. The inhabitants afterwards removed
to a spot not far distant from Old Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, and the
name of Apama was given to their new city, from Apama the
sister of king Seleucus. The river Marsyas also, rising at a
little distance from the head of the M&aelig;ander, falls into the
latter river, and report so has it, that at Cel&aelig;n&aelig; Marsyas contended
with Apollo in the music of the pipe. The M&aelig;ander,
springing up in the highest part of the citadel of Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, runs
down through the middle of the city, then through Caria, afterwards
through Ionia, and empties itself into a bay which
lies between Priene and Miletus. Seleucus, son of Antiochus,
came into the consul&#8217;s camp at Antioch, to furnish corn for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1735" id="Page_1735">Pg 1735</a></span>
the troops, in conformity with the treaty with Scipio. Here a
small dispute arose, concerning the auxiliary troops of Attalus;
for Seleucus affirmed, that Antiochus engaged to supply
corn to the Roman soldiers only. This difference was terminated
by the firmness of the consul, who gave orders to a
tribune despatched by him, that the Roman soldiers should
receive none, until the auxiliaries under Attalus should have
received their share. From hence the army advanced to Gordiutichos,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
as they call it: from which place it marched, in
three days, to Tab&aelig;. This city stands on the confines of Pisidia,
in that part which verges to the Pamphylian sea.
Whilst the strength of that country was unimpaired, it produced
valiant warriors: and even on this occasion, their
horsemen, sallying out on the Roman troops, caused by their
first onset no small confusion; then, as soon as it appeared
that they were not equal to them either in numbers or
bravery, being driven back to the city, they begged pardon for
their transgressions, and offered to surrender the city. They
were ordered to pay twenty-five talents of silver,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and ten
thousand bushels of wheat; and on these terms their surrender
was accepted.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b14" name="b14"></a>14</span>
On the third day after their leaving this place, the army
reached the river Chaus, and proceeding thence, took the
city of Eriza at the first assault. They then came to Thabusios,
a fort standing on the bank of the river Indus, to which
an elephant&#8217;s guide thrown from the animal had given its
name. They were now not far from Cibyra, yet no embassy
appeared from Moagetes, the tyrant of that state; a
man faithless and tyrannical in every respect. The consul,
in order to sound his intentions, sent forward Caius Helvius,
with four thousand foot and five hundred horse. Ambassadors
met this body on their entrance into his territories, declaring,
that the king was ready to execute their commands.
They entreated Helvius to enter their confines in a friendly
manner, and to restrain his soldiers from plundering the land;
and they brought with them in lieu of a golden crown fifteen
talents. Helvius, having promised to keep their lands safe
from plunderers, ordered the ambassadors to go on to the consul.
And when they delivered the same message to him, the
consul said, &#8220;We Romans have not any sign of the tyrant&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1736" id="Page_1736">Pg 1736</a></span>
good will towards us, and we are agreed that he is such
a person that we ought rather to think of punishing him than
of contracting friendship with him.&#8221; Struck with astonishment
at such a reception, the ambassadors requested nothing more
than that he should receive the present, and give permission
to the tyrant to come to him, and an opportunity to speak and
excuse himself. By the permission of the consul, the tyrant
came next day into the camp. His dress and retinue were
scarcely equal to the style of a private person of moderate
fortune; while his discourse was humble and incoherent, depreciating
his own wealth and complaining of the poverty of
the cities under his sway. He had under his dominion, (beside
Cibyra,) Syleum, and the city called Alimne. Out of these
he promised (in such a manner as if he were diffident that he
could strip himself and his subjects of so much) to raise
twenty-five talents.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> &#8220;Truly,&#8221; said the consul, &#8220;this trifling
cannot be borne. It is not enough for you that you did not
blush, though absent, when you were imposing on us by your
ambassadors; but even when present you persist in the same
effrontery. Is it that twenty-five talents would exhaust your
dominions? If within three days you do not pay down five
hundred talents,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> expect the devastation of your lands and
the siege of your city.&#8221; Although terrified by this menace,
he persisted obstinately in his plea of poverty; gradually by
illiberal advances, (sometimes cavilling, sometimes recurring
to prayers and counterfeit tears,) he was brought to agree to
the payment of one hundred talents,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> to which, were added ten
thousand bushels of corn. All this was done within six
days.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b15" name="b15"></a>15</span>
From Cibyra the army was led through the territory of
the Sindensians, and, after crossing the river Caularis, encamped.
Next day they marched along the side of the lake of Caralitis,
and passed the night at Mandropolis. As they advanced to the
next city, Lagos, the inhabitants fled through fear. The place
being deserted, yet filled with abundance of every thing, was pillaged
by the soldiers. From this they marched to the sources
of the river Lysis, and on the next day to the river Cobulatus.
At this time the Termessians were besieging the citadel of
the Isiondensians, after having taken the city. The besieged,
when they had no other hope of aid, sent ambassadors to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1737" id="Page_1737">Pg 1737</a></span>
consul, imploring succour; adding, that, &#8220;being shut up in
the citadel, with their wives and children, they were in daily
expectation of suffering death, either by the sword or famine.&#8221;
An occasion for turning aside to Pamphylia was thereby offered
to the consul, who was very desirous of it. By his approach he
raised the siege of Isionda. He granted peace to Termessus on
receiving fifty talents of silver;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and, likewise, to the Aspendians
and other states of Pamphylia. Returning from Pamphylia
he pitched his camp, the first day, at the river Taurus, and
the second at Come Xyline,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> as they call it. Departing from
which, he proceeded, by uninterrupted marches, to the city
of Cormasa. The next city was Darsa, which he found abandoned
by the inhabitants through fear, but filled with abundance
of every thing useful. Ambassadors from Lysinoe, with
the surrender of that state, met him while marching along the
marshes. He then came into the Sagalassenian territory, rich
and abounding in every kind of production. The inhabitants
are Pisidians, the best soldiers, by far, of any in that part of the
world. This circumstance, as well as the fertility of their soil,
the multitude of their people, and the situation of their city, preeminently
fortified, gave them boldness. The consul sent a
party to ravage the country, because no embassy attended him
on the frontiers. Then, at length, their obstinacy was overcome,
as soon as they saw their property carried off and driven away.
After sending ambassadors, and agreeing to pay fifty talents,
with twenty thousand bushels of wheat and twenty thousand
of barley, they obtained peace. The consul then marched to the
source of the Obrima, and encamped at a village called Come
Acaridos.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Hither Seleucus came, next day, from Apamea.
Then when the consul had sent the sick and the useless baggage
to Apamea, having received guides from Seleucus, he
marched that day into the plain of Metropolis, and advanced
on the day following to Dini&aelig; in Phrygia, and thence to Synnas;
all the towns on every side being deserted by the inhabitants
through fear. And now, bringing along his army
encumbered with the spoil of those cities, after scarcely
completing in a whole day a march of five miles, he arrived at
a town called Old Beudi. Next day he encamped at Anabura;
on the following, at the source of the Alander, and on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1738" id="Page_1738">Pg 1738</a></span>
third at Abassus, where he halted for several days, because
he arrived at the borders of the Tolistoboians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b16" name="b16"></a>16</span>
These Gauls, in a very numerous body, induced either
by scarcity of land or hopes of plunder, and thinking that no
nation through which they were to pass would be a match for
them in arms, made their way under the command of Brennus
into Dardania. There a dissension arose, and about twenty
thousand men under the chieftains Leonorius and Lutarius, a
secession being made from Brennus, turned their route to
Thrace. Then when, fighting with such as resisted them, and
imposing a tribute on such as sued for peace, they had arrived
at Byzantium, they held possession for a long time of the
cities in that quarter, laying the coast of the Propontis under
contribution. Then a desire of passing over into Asia seized
them, hearing in the neighbourhood how great the fertility of
that continent was; and, having taken Lysimachia by treachery,
and possessed themselves of the whole Chersonesus by force
of arms, they went down to the Hellespont. When they
there beheld Asia separated from them by a narrow strait,
their wishes to pass into it were much more highly inflamed,
and they despatched envoys to Antipater, governor of that
coast, to treat of a passage. And when, business being protracted
to a greater length than they expected, a new quarrel
broke out between their chieftains, Leonorius, with the greater
part of the people, went back to Byzantium, whence they came:
Lutarius takes two decked ships and three barks from some Macedonians,
sent by Antipater, under the pretext of an embassy,
to act as spies. By carrying over in these galleys detachment
after detachment, day and night, he transported all his troops
within a few days. Not long after, Leonorius, with the assistance
of Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, passed over from Byzantium.
The Gauls then re-united their forces, and assisted
Nicomedes in a war which he was carrying on against Zyb&#339;ta,
who held possession of a part of Bithynia. By their
assistance chiefly Zyb&#339;ta was subdued, and the whole of
Bithynia reduced under the dominion of Nicomedes. Then
leaving Bithynia, they advanced into Asia; and although, of
their twenty thousand men, not more than ten thousand carried
arms, yet such a degree of terror did they strike into all
the natives, dwelling on this side of Taurus, that those which
they visited, and those which they did not visit, the most remote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1739" id="Page_1739">Pg 1739</a></span>
as well as the nearest, submitted to their authority. At
length as there were three tribes of them, the Tolistoboians, the
Trocmians, and the Tectosagians, they made a division of Asia
into three provinces, according to which it was made tributary
to each of their states. The coast of the Hellespont was assigned
to the Trocmians; the Tolistoboians obtained of the allotment
&AElig;olia and Ionia; the Tectosagians received the inland parts
of Asia. They levied tribute throughout every part of Asia
on this side Mount Taurus; but chose their own residence
on the banks of the river Halys; and so great was the terror
of their name, their numbers, too, increasing by a rapid population,
that at last even the kings of Syria did not refuse to
pay them tribute. The first of all the inhabitants of Asia
who refused, was Attalus, the father of king Eumenes; and
beyond the expectation of all, fortune favoured his bold resolution,
and he defeated them in a pitched battle; yet he did
not so effectually break their spirits, as to make them give up
their pretensions to empire. Their power continued the same
until the war between Antiochus and the Romans; and, even
then, after Antiochus was expelled the country, they still entertained
a hope, that, as they lived remote from the sea, the
Roman army would not come so far.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b17" name="b17"></a>17</span>
As the troops were about to act against this enemy,
so terrible to all in that part of the world, the consul, in
an assembly, addressed the soldiers for the most part to
this effect: &#8220;It does not escape me, that, of all the nations
inhabiting Asia, the Gauls are pre-eminent for military fame.
A fierce nation, after overrunning the face of the earth with
its arms, has fixed its abode in the midst of a race of men the
gentlest in the world. Their tall persons, their long red hair,
their vast shields, and swords of enormous length; their songs
also, when they are advancing to action, their yells and dances,
and the horrid clashing of their armour, while they brandish
their shields in a peculiar manner, practised in their original
country; all these circumstances are preconcerted to inspire
terror. But let Greeks, and Phrygians, and Carians, to whom
these things are unusual and strange, be frightened by such
acts: to the Romans, accustomed to Gallic tumults, even these
vain efforts to strike terror are known. Once our ancestors fled
from them, but it was long ago, when they first met them at
the Allia. Ever since that time, for, now, two hundred years,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1740" id="Page_1740">Pg 1740</a></span>
the Romans drive them before them in dismay, and kill them
like cattle; there have, indeed, been more triumphs celebrated
over the Gauls, than over almost all the rest of the world. It is
now well known by experience, that if you sustain their first onset,
which they make with fiery eagerness and blind fury, their
limbs are unnerved with sweat and fatigue; their arms flag;
and, though you should not employ a weapon on them, the
sun, dust, and thirst prostrate their enervated bodies and
minds when their fury has ceased. We have tried them,
not only with our legions against theirs, but in single combat,
man to man. Titus Manlius and Marcus Valerius
have demonstrated how far Roman valour surpasses Gallic
fury. Marcus Manlius, singly, thrust back the Gauls who
were mounting the Capitol in a body. Our forefathers had to
deal with genuine Gauls, born in their own lands; but they
are now degenerate, a mongrel race, and, in reality, what they
are named, Gallogr&aelig;cians; just as is the case of vegetables
and cattle, the seeds are not so efficacious in preserving their
original constitution, as the properties of the soil and climate
under which they are reared, are in changing it. The Macedonians
who settled at Alexandria in Egypt, or in Seleucia, or
Babylonia, or in any other of their colonies scattered over
the world, have sunk into Syrians, Parthians, or Egyptians.
Marseilles, owing to its situation in the midst of Gauls, has
contracted somewhat of the disposition of its adjoining neighbours.
What of the hardy, rugged discipline of Sparta hath
remained to the Tarentines? Every thing is produced in
higher perfection in its own native soil; whatever is planted
in a foreign land, by a gradual change in its nature, degenerates
into that by which it is nurtured. Therefore you, victorious,
will slay the conquered Phrygians, though laden with
Gallic armour, as you slew them in the ranks of Antiochus. I
am more apprehensive of our gaining but little honour from
the victory, than of the struggle being a severe one. King
Attalus often routed and put them to flight. Do you think
that brutes only, when taken, retain at first their natural ferocity,
and subsequently grow tame, after being long fed by the
hands of men; and that nature does not exert the same power
in softening the savage disposition of men. Do you believe
these to be of the same kind that their fathers and grandfathers
were? Exiles from home through scarcity of land, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1741" id="Page_1741">Pg 1741</a></span>
marched along the craggy coast of Illyricum, then traversed
P&aelig;onia and Thrace, in a continual struggle against the fiercest
nations, and took possession of these countries. A land which
could glut them with plenty of every thing, received them
hardened and infuriated by so many evils. By the very great
fertility of the soil, the very great mildness of the climate,
and the gentle dispositions of the neighbouring nations, all
that fierceness with which they came has been quite mollified.
You, by Hercules, who are the sons of Mars, ought to guard
against the seductions of Asia, and shun them from the very
first; so great is the power of those foreign pleasures in extinguishing
the vigour of the mind, so strong the contagion
from the relaxed discipline and manners of the people about
you. One thing has happened fortunately; that though they
will not bring against you a degree of strength by any means
equal to what they formerly possessed, yet they still retain a
character among the Greeks equal to what they had at their
first coming; consequently you, when victors, will acquire
the same warlike renown, as if you had conquered the Gauls
still acting up to their ancient standard of courage.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b18" name="b18"></a>18</span>
Having then dismissed the assembly, and having
despatched ambassadors to Eposognatus, (who alone of all
the petty princes had remained in friendship with Eumenes,
and refused to assist Antiochus against the Romans,) he proceeded
on his march. He came the first day to the river
Alander, and the next to a village called Tyscos. When
ambassadors of the Oroandensians had come to that place,
seeking amity, two hundred talents<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> were levied on them; and
on their requesting that they might bear this announcement
home, permission to do so was given. The consul then led
the army to Plitendos; then the Roman camp was pitched at
Alyatti. The persons sent to Eposognatus returned to him
here, and with them ambassadors from that chieftain, who
entreated him not to make war on the Tolistoboians, for that
Eposognatus himself would go among that people and persuade
them to submit. This request of the prince was complied
with. The army then began to march through the country
called Axylos:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> which derives its name from the nature of
the place; for it not only does not produce timber, but not
even brambles, or any species of fire-wood. The inhabitants,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1742" id="Page_1742">Pg 1742</a></span>
instead of wood, use cow dung. While the Romans were
encamped at Cuballum, a fort of Gallogr&aelig;cia, the enemy&#8217;s
cavalry appeared with great tumult. They not only disordered
by their sudden charge the advanced guards of the
Romans, but killed several of the men; and when this alarm
was spread to the camp, the Roman cavalry, pouring out
hastily by all the gates, routed and dispersed the Gauls, and
killed many as they fled. The consul, now perceiving that he
had reached the enemy&#8217;s country, marched henceforth exploring
his route and carefully bringing up his rear. When
by continued marches he had arrived at the river Sangarius,
he set about constructing a bridge, because no where was
there a passage by a ford. The Sangarius, running from the
mountain of Adoreus, through Phrygia, joins the river Thymbris
at the confines of Bithynia. After doubling its quantity
of water by this junction, it proceeds in a more copious
stream through Bithynia, and empties itself into the Euxine
Sea. Yet it is not so remarkable for the size of its current, as
for the vast quantity of fish which it supplies to the people in
its vicinity. When the bridge was finished, and the army
had passed the river, as they were marching along the bank,
the Gallic priests of the Great Mother, coming from Pessinus
with the symbols of their office, met them; who, in inspired
rhymes, foretold that the goddess would grant the Romans a
safe passage, success in the war, and the empire over that
country. When the consul had said that he embraced the
omen, he pitched his camp on that very spot. On the following
day he arrived at Gordium. This is not a large town,
but a mart more frequented and noted than an inland town
generally is. It has three seas nearly at equal distances from
it, that at the Hellespont, that at Sinope, and that at the shore
of the opposite coast, in which the maritime Cilicians dwell.
It is also contiguous to the borders of many and great nations,
the commerce of which has been centred by mutual convenience
principally in this place. The Romans found the town deserted
owing to the flight of the inhabitants, yet at the same time
filled with plenty of every thing. While they halted here,
ambassadors came from Eposognatus, with information that
&#8220;he had applied to the petty princes of the Gauls, and had
been unable to bring them to reason; that they were
removing in crowds from the villages and lands in the open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1743" id="Page_1743">Pg 1743</a></span>
country; and, with their wives and children, carrying and
driving whatever could be carried or driven, were going to
Mount Olympus, that there they might defend themselves by
their arms and the nature of the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b19" name="b19"></a>19</span>
Deputies from the Oroandensians afterwards brought
more particular intelligence; that &#8220;the state of the Tolistoboians
had seized Mount Olympus, but that the Tectosagians,
taking a different route, were gone to another mountain called
Magaba; and that the Trocmians, leaving their wives and
children in charge with the Tectosagians, had resolved to
carry their armed force to the assistance of the Tolistoboians.&#8221;
The chieftains of the three states were at that time, Ortiagon,
Combolomarus, and Gaulotus; and this was their reason in particular
for choosing this mode of warfare, because as they had
possession of the highest mountains in that part of the world,
and had conveyed thither stores of every kind, sufficient for
their consumption during the time, although long, they
thought that they would weary out the enemy by the tediousness
of the enterprise: &#8220;for neither would they dare to climb
over places so steep and uneven; and if they should attempt
it, they could be prevented and driven down, even by a small
band; nor would they, sitting in inactivity at the foot of the
frosty mountains, endure cold and hunger.&#8221; Although the
height of their posts was in itself a strong defence, yet they
drew, besides, a trench and other fortifications round the
summits which they occupied. The least part of their care
was employed in providing a stock of missile weapons; for
they trusted that the rocky ground itself would furnish stones
in abundance.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b20" name="b20"></a>20</span>
The consul, as he had foreseen that the fight would
not be hand to hand, but at a distance, in the attack of
the enemy&#8217;s post, had prepared an immense quantity of
javelins, light infantry, spears, arrows, balls of lead, and
small stones, fit to be thrown with slings. Furnished with
this stock of missile weapons, he marched towards Mount
Olympus, and encamped within five miles of it. On the
next day, as he was advancing with four hundred horse, and
Attalus, to examine the nature of the mountain and situation
of the camp of the Gauls; a party of the enemy&#8217;s cavalry,
double in number to his, sallying from the camp, forced him
to take to flight. A few of his soldiers were killed in the flight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1744" id="Page_1744">Pg 1744</a></span>
and several wounded. On the third day, marching to explore the
ground at the head of all his cavalry, as none of the enemy
advanced beyond their fortifications, he rode round the mountain
with safety, and saw that on the south side the hills were
composed of earth, and rose to a certain height, with a gentle
slope, but that on the north there was nothing but steep and
almost perpendicular cliffs; and that there were but three
practicable ways, almost all the others being impassable; one
at the middle of the mountain, where the ground was earthy,
and two others, both very difficult, one on the south-east, and
the other on the north-west. After taking a full view of all
these places, he pitched his camp that day close to the foot of
the mountain. On the day following, after that, offering
sacrifice, he had received favourable auspices with the first
victims, he proceeds to lead his army, in three divisions,
against the enemy. He himself, with the greatest part of the
forces, marched up where the mountain afforded the easiest
ascent. He ordered his brother, Lucius Manlius, to ascend
on the south-east side, as far as the ground allowed him to
do so with safety; but if any dangerous and steep precipices
should lie in his way, then not to contend with the unfavourable
nature of the place, or attempt to conquer insuperable
obstacles, but by a slope across the mountain to incline
towards him, and join the body under his command; and he
directed Caius Helvius, with the third division, to march
round leisurely, by the foot of the mountain, and to climb the
hill on the north-east. The auxiliary troops of Attalus he
distributed equally among the three divisions, ordering the
young prince to accompany him. The cavalry and elephants
he left in the plain, at the foot of the hills; orders
were given to the prefects to watch attentively every thing
that should happen, and to be expeditious in bringing succour
wherever circumstances should require it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b21" name="b21"></a>21</span>
The Gauls, (thoroughly satisfied that the ground on
their two flanks was impassable,) in order to secure, by arms,
the ascent on the side which was situated towards the south,
sent about four thousand soldiers to keep possession of a hill
which hung over the road, at the distance of near a mile from
their camp; hoping that they might stop the enemies&#8217; progress
by this as by a fortress. Which when the Romans saw, they
prepared for battle. The light infantry marched a little in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1745" id="Page_1745">Pg 1745</a></span>
advance of the line, supported by draughts from Attalus&#8217;s troops,
composed of the Cretan archers and slingers, the Trallians and
Thracians. The battalions of infantry, as the ground was steep,
marched at a slow pace, holding their shields before them,
merely to ward off missile weapons, as they did not seem likely
to fight in a close engagement. The fight commenced with the
missile weapons, at the proper interval, and was at first equal.
as the situation aided the Gauls, the variety and abundance of
weapons, the Romans. But, as the contest advanced, there
was no longer any equality: their shields, long, but too narrow
for the breadth of their bodies, and besides being flat, ill protected
the Gauls. Nor had they now any other weapons except
their swords, which they had no opportunity of using, as
the enemy did not come to close action. They used stones,
and these not of a proper size, as they had not previously laid
them up, but whatever came to the hand of each in his haste
and confusion, as persons unaccustomed generally do, aiding
the blow neither by skill nor strength. Incautiously exposing
themselves, they were transfixed on all sides by arrows, leaden
balls, and darts; nor did they know what to do, their minds
being paralysed by rage and fear; and they were engaged in
a kind of fight for which they were least of all qualified. For,
as in a close encounter, where they can receive and give
wounds in turn, rage inflames their courage; so when they are
wounded at a distance, with light weapons from unknown hands,
and have no object on which they can rush in their blind fury,
they rush forward at random, like wounded wild beasts,
often upon their own party. Their wounds were more conspicuous
because they always fight naked, and their bodies are
large and white, since they are never stripped except in battle;
thus more blood was poured from their large persons,
and the cuts appeared the more shocking, while the whiteness
of their skins offered a stronger contrast to the black
blood. But they were not much moved by open wounds.
Sometimes they even cut off the skin, when the wound was
more broad than deep, thinking that in this condition they
fought with the greater glory. But when the point of an arrow
or a ball, sinking deep in the flesh, tormented them, with a
wound small in appearance, and the weapon did not come forth
although they used every effort to extract it, then they fell into
fits of phrensy and shame, at being destroyed by so small a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1746" id="Page_1746">Pg 1746</a></span>
hurt; and dashing themselves on the ground, they lay scattered
over the place. Some rushing against the enemy were
overwhelmed with darts; and when any of them came near,
they were slain by the swords of the light infantry. A soldier
of this description carries a shield three feet long, and, in
his right hand, javelins, which he throws at a distance. He
is begirt with a Spanish sword, and when he must fight in
close encounter, having shifted his spears into his left hand,
he draws it. There were few of the Gauls now left; and
these, seeing themselves overpowered by the light infantry,
and the battalions of the legions advancing, fled in confusion
to the camp, now full of tumult and dismay, as the women,
children, and others unfit to bear arms, were all crowded together
there. The hills, thus abandoned by the enemy, were
seized by the victorious Romans.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b22" name="b22"></a>22</span>
At this juncture, Lucius Manlius and Caius Helvius,
having marched up as high as the sloping hills allowed them
to do, after they came to insuperable steeps, turned towards
that side of the mountain which alone had a practicable ascent;
and began, as if by concert, to follow the consul&#8217;s party
at a moderate distance; being driven by necessity to adopt the
plan, now, which would have been the best at the beginning.
For in such disadvantageous ground reserves have often been
of the utmost use; for instance, should the first line happen to
be repulsed, the second may both cover their retreat, and, being
fresh, succeed to their place in the fight. The consul, as soon as
the vanguard of the legions reached the hills taken by the light
infantry, ordered the troops to halt and take breath; at the
same time he showed them the bodies of the Gauls spread
about the hills, asking them, &#8220;Since the light troops had
fought such a battle, what might be expected from the legions,
from a regular army, and from the spirit of the bravest soldiers?
They ought certainly to take the camp into which
the enemy had been driven in confusion by the light infantry.&#8221;
He then orders the light infantry to go forward,
who, while the army halted, had not spent their time in
idleness, but in gathering weapons about the hills, that there
might be a sufficient supply of missiles. They now approached
the camp. The Gauls, lest their fortifications
might not give them sufficient protection, had posted themselves,
in arms, on the outside of the rampart. Then being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1747" id="Page_1747">Pg 1747</a></span>
overwhelmed with weapons of every description, since in proportion
as they were more numerous and crowded together,
the less likely were the weapons to fall between them without
effect, they were driven in an instant within their trenches,
leaving only strong guards at the entrances of the gates.
Against the crowd that fled into the camp a vast quantity of
missile weapons was discharged, and the shouts, intermixed
with lamentations of the women and children, showed that
great numbers were wounded. The first line of the legions
hurled their javelins against those who were posted to
guard the gate; these, however, were not wounded, but
most of them, having their shields pierced through, were entangled
and fastened together, nor did they longer withstand
the attack.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b23" name="b23"></a>23</span>
The gates being now open, a flight of the Gauls in
every direction from the camp took place before the victors
could burst in. They rushed on blindly through passable and
impassable places; no craggy cliffs, nor even perpendicular
rocks, stopped them; they feared nothing but the enemy.
Great numbers, therefore, falling down precipices of vast
height, were either maimed or killed. The consul, taking
possession of the camp, restrained the soldiers from plunder
and booty; he orders every one to pursue with his utmost
speed, to press on the enemy, and to increase their panic while
they were in dismay. The other party, under Lucius Manlius,
now came up. These he did not suffer to enter the
camp, but sent them forward in the pursuit, and followed
shortly in person, after committing the guard of the prisoners
to some military tribunes: for he thought that the war would
be finished, if in that consternation the greatest possible number
should be slain or taken prisoners. After the consul&#8217;s departure,
Caius Helvius arrived, with the third division: he
was not able to prevent their sacking the camp; and, by a
most unjust dispensation, the booty fell into the hands of men
who had not had any concern in the action. The cavalry
stood for a long time ignorant of the fight, and of the success
of their army. At last, they also, as far as they could ascend
the hills on horseback, pursuing the Gauls, (who were now
dispersed round the foot of the mountain,) either killed or made
prisoners of them. The number of the slain could not easily be
ascertained because the flight and slaughter were widely extended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1748" id="Page_1748">Pg 1748</a></span>
through all the windings of the mountains; and a great
number fell from impassable cliffs into cavities of prodigious
depth; others were killed in the woods and thickets. Claudius,
who mentions two battles on Mount Olympus, asserts, that forty-thousand
fell in them; yet Valerius Antias, who is generally
addicted to great exaggeration on the point of numbers, says,
not more than ten thousand. The number of prisoners undoubtedly
amounted to forty thousand, because the Gauls had
dragged along with them a crowd of people of all descriptions
and of all ages, like men removing to another country, rather
than going out to war. The consul, having burnt the arms of
the enemy collected in one heap, then ordered all to bring together
the rest of the booty, and either sold that portion which
was to be applied to the use of the public, or distributed the
remainder among the soldiers, taking care that the shares
should be as just as possible. They were all praised in a public
assembly, and presented with gifts each according to his
merit; Attalus was distinguished above all, with the general
approbation of the rest. For not only were the courage and
activity of that young prince conspicuous in undergoing
dangers and fatigue, but also the modesty of his deportment.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b24" name="b24"></a>24</span>
The war with the Tectosagians remained still in its
original state. The consul, marching against them, arrived,
on the third day, at Ancyra, a city remarkable in those parts,
from which the enemy were but a little more than ten miles
distant. While his camp lay there, a memorable action was
performed by a female. Among many other captives, the wife
of the Gallic chieftain Ortiagon, a woman of exquisite beauty,
was strictly guarded, and a centurion, possessing the lust and
avarice usual among military men, commanded this guard.
He, first, endeavoured to learn her sentiments; but, finding
that she abhorred the thought of voluntary prostitution, he
offered violence to her person, which by the decree of fortune
was his slave. Afterwards, in order to soothe her indignation
at the insult, he gives the lady hope of a return to her friends;
and not even that gratuitously, like a lover. He stipulated
for a certain weight of gold, but, being unwilling to have any
of his countrymen privy to it, he gave her leave to send any
one of the prisoners, whom she chose, as a messenger to her
friends. He appointed a spot near the river, to which two of
this woman&#8217;s friends, and not more, were to come with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1749" id="Page_1749">Pg 1749</a></span>
gold in the night following, to receive her. It happened that
among the prisoners under the same guard was a servant of
the lady; the centurion, as soon as it grew dark, conveyed
this messenger beyond the advanced posts. Her friends came
to the place at the appointed time, likewise the centurion
with his prisoner. Here, on their producing the gold, which
mounted to an Attic talent, for he had stipulated for that
sum the lady in her own language ordered them to draw their
swords, and kill the centurion, while he was weighing the
gold. She herself, bearing wrapped up in her garment the
head of the slain centurion, detached from the trunk, reached
her husband Ortiagon, who had fled home from Olympus.
And before she would embrace him, she threw down the centurion&#8217;s
head at his feet; and on his asking, with astonishment,
whose head it was, and what was the meaning of such
a proceeding, so unaccountable in a female, she acknowledged
to her husband the injury committed on her person, and the
vengeance she had taken for the forcible violation of her chastity.
She maintained to the last, as it is said, by the purity
and strictness of the rest of her life, the glory of this achievement,
so honourable to her sex.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b25" name="b25"></a>25</span>
Envoys from the Tectosagians met the consul at Ancyra,
entreating him not to decamp until he had held a conference
with their kings; that any conditions of peace were
in their opinion preferable to war. The time fixed was the
next day, and the place that which seemed the most central between
the camp of the Gauls and Ancyra. The consul came
thither at the appointed hour, with a guard of five hundred
horse, but seeing none of the Gauls there, returned into his
camp: after which the same envoys came again, with an apology,
that their kings could not come, since religious feelings
deterred them; but that the principal men of the nation would
attend, and that the business might be as well transacted by
them. To which the consul answered, that he would send
Attalus on his part. To this meeting both parties came.
When Attalus had brought with him as an escort three hundred
horse, the terms of peace were proposed. As there
could not be a conclusion to the affair in the absence of the
leaders, it was agreed, that the consul and the kings should
meet in the same place on the following day. The delay of the
Gauls had the following objects: first, to waste time, that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1750" id="Page_1750">Pg 1750</a></span>
might remove their effects, which they were unwilling to risk,
and also their wives and children, to the other side of the
river Halys; and, secondly, because they were framing a plot
against the consul, who took no precautions against treachery
in the conference. They chose for this purpose, out of all
their number, one thousand horsemen of approved intrepidity;
and their treachery would have taken effect, had not fortune
exerted herself in favour of the law of nations, in violation of
which their plan was laid. The Roman parties, who went out for
forage and wood, were led towards that quarter where the conference
was to be held; for the tribunes judged that to be the
safest course, as they would have the consul&#8217;s escort, and himself,
as a guard opposed to the enemy. However, they posted
another guard of their own, of six hundred horse, nearer to
the camp. The consul, being assured by Attalus that the
kings would come, and that the business might be concluded,
having set out from his camp with the same attendants
as before, when he had advanced about five miles, and was
not far from the place appointed, he saw, on a sudden, the
Gauls coming on with hostile fury, and with their horses at full
gallop. He halted, and ordering his horsemen to make ready
their arms, and recall their courage, received the enemy&#8217;s first
charge with firmness, nor gave way. At length, when their numbers
were overpowering him, he began to retreat leisurely, without
disturbing the order of the troops, but at last, when there
was more danger in delay than protection in keeping their
ranks, they all fled in hurry and disorder. Then truly the
Gauls pressed hard on them, dispersed, and killed several;
and a great part of them would have been cut off, had not the
six hundred horse, the guard of the foragers, come up to meet
them. These, on hearing, at a distance, the shout of dismay
raised by their friends, made ready their weapons and horses,
and, being quite fresh, renewed the fight after it was almost
over. The fortune of the battle, therefore, was instantly reversed,
and dismay recoiled from the conquered on the conquerors.
At the first charge the Gauls were routed; at the
same time the foragers from the fields ran together towards
the spot, and an enemy was on every side of the Gauls in such
a manner that they could not have an easy or safe retreat,
especially as the Romans pursued on fresh horses, while theirs
were fatigued. Few therefore escaped; yet not one was taken;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1751" id="Page_1751">Pg 1751</a></span>
by far the greater part paid their lives as a forfeit for having
violated the faith of a conference. The whole army of the
Romans, with minds burning with rage, marched up, next
day, close to the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b26" name="b26"></a>26</span>
The consul, that no particular should escape his knowledge,
spent two days in examining the nature of the mountain
with his own eyes. On the third day, after taking the
auspices, and then offering sacrifice, he formed his troops in
four divisions, that he might lead two up the middle of the
mountain, and direct the other two, one on each side, against
the wings of the Gauls. The main strength of the enemy,
the Tectosagians and Trocmians, amounting to fifty thousand
men, formed the centre of their line. They dismounted their
cavalry, in number ten thousand men, because horsemen
could not act among the uneven rocks, and placed them on
the right wing. The Cappadocians of Ariarathes, with the
auxiliary troops of Morzes, on the left, made up almost four
thousand. The consul, having placed his light troops in the
van, as he had done before at Mount Olympus, took care
that they should have ready at hand the same abundance of
weapons of every sort. When they approached the enemy,
all circumstances, on both sides, were the same as in the former
battle, excepting their spirits; those of the victors being elated
by their success, and those of the Gauls depressed; because,
though they themselves had not been defeated, yet they considered
as their own, the overthrow of people of their own race.
The battle, therefore, commencing under similar circumstances,
had the same issue. The cloud, as it were, of light weapons
that were thrown, overwhelmed the army of the Gauls; and,
as none of them dared to charge forward from their ranks,
for fear of exposing all parts of their bodies to the blows, so
while they stood still, the closer they were together the more
wounds they received, as the assailants directed their weapons
as if at a mark. The consul now judged, that if he should once
show the standards of the legions to them already disordered,
they would instantly turn about and fly; receiving, therefore,
the light infantry, and the rest of the auxiliaries, between the
ranks, he ordered the line to advance.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b27" name="b27"></a>27</span>
The Gauls, discouraged by the memory of the defeat of
the Tolistoboians, and carrying weapons sticking in their flesh,
fatigued also by long standing and wounds, were not able to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1752" id="Page_1752">Pg 1752</a></span>
support even the first shout and onset of the Romans. Their
flight was directed towards their camp; only a few of them
entered the trenches; the greater part, passing by, on the
right and left, fled whichever way each man&#8217;s giddy haste carried
him. The conquerors, following them to the camp, cut
off their rear; but then, through greediness for booty, they
stopped in the camp, and not one of them continued the pursuit.
The Gauls in the wings stood some time longer, because
the Romans reached them at a later period. But they did not
endure even the first discharge of weapons. The consul, as he
could not draw off the men who had got into the camp for plunder,
sent forward those, who had been in the wings, to pursue
the enemy. They, accordingly, followed them a considerable
way; yet, in the pursuit, for there was no fight, they killed not
more than eight thousand men: the rest crossed the river
Halys. A great part of the Romans lodged that night in the
enemy&#8217;s camp; the consul led back the rest to his own. Next
day, he took a review of the prisoners, and of the booty, the
quantity of which was as great as a nation most greedy of
rapine could amass, after holding possession, by force of arms,
of all the country on this side Mount Taurus, during a space
of many years. The Gauls, after this scattered and confused
flight, re-assembled in one place, a great part of them being
wounded or unarmed, and as all were destitute of every kind
of property, they sent deputies to the consul, to supplicate for
peace. Manlius ordered them to attend him at Ephesus; and,
being in haste to quit those cold regions, in the vicinity of
Mount Taurus, as it was now the middle of autumn, he led back
his victorious army into winter quarters on the sea-coast.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b28" name="b28"></a>28</span>
During the time of those transactions in Asia, affairs
were tranquil in the other provinces. At Rome, the censors,
Titus Quintius Flamininus and Marcus Claudius Marcellus,
read over the roll of the senate; Publius Scipio Africanus was,
a third time, declared prince of the senate, and only four members
were struck out, none of whom had held any curule office.
In their review of the knights, also, their censorship was very
mild. They contracted for the erection of a building in the
&AElig;quim&aelig;lium, on the capitoline mount, and for paving, with
flint, a road from the gate Capena to the temple of Mars. The
Campanians consulted the senate respecting the place where
they should have their census; and an order was passed that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1753" id="Page_1753">Pg 1753</a></span>
they should be rated at Rome. Extraordinary quantities of rain
fell this year; twelve times the Tiber overflowed the field of
Mars and the lower parts of the city. The war with the Gauls
in Asia having been brought to a conclusion by the consul
Cneius Manlius, the other consul, Marcus Fulvius, as the
&AElig;tolians were now completely reduced, passed over to Cephallenia,
and sent messengers round the states of the island,
to inquire whether they chose to submit to the Romans, or
to try the fortune of war. Fear prevailed so strongly on
them all, that they did not refuse to surrender. They gave
the number of hostages demanded, which was proportioned to
the abilities of a weak people, the Nesians, Cranians, Pallenians,
and Sam&aelig;ans, giving twenty each. An unhoped-for peace had
now shone on Cephallenia, when one state, the Sam&aelig;ans, suddenly
revolted, from some motive not yet ascertained. They
said, that as their city was commodiously situated, they were
afraid that the Romans would compel them to remove from it.
But whether, they conceived this in their own minds, and, under
the impulse of a groundless fear, disturbed the general quiet,
or whether, such a project had been mentioned in conversation
among the Romans, and reported to them, nothing is
ascertained, unless that after having given hostages they suddenly
shut their gates, and would not relinquish their design,
even for the prayers of their friends, whom the consul sent
to the walls, to try how far they might be influenced by compassion
for their parents and countrymen. When no pacific
answer was given, the city began to be besieged. The consul
had all the apparatus, engines and machines, which had been
brought over from Ambracia; and the soldiers executed with
great diligence the works necessary to be formed. The rams
were therefore brought forward in two places, and began to
batter the walls.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b29" name="b29"></a>29</span>
The townsmen omitted nothing by which the works or
the motions of the besiegers could be obstructed. But they
resisted in two ways in particular; one of which was to raise
constantly, instead of the part of the wall knocked down, a new
wall of equal strength on the inside; and the other was to
make sudden sallies, at one time against the enemy&#8217;s works, at
another against his advanced guards; and in those attacks, they
generally got the better. The only plan that was invented to
confine them within the walls, though ineffectual, deserves to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1754" id="Page_1754">Pg 1754</a></span>
recorded. One hundred slingers were brought from &AElig;gium,
Patras, and Dym&aelig;. These men, according to the customary
practice of that nation, were exercised from their childhood in
throwing with a sling, into the open sea, the round pebbles, with
which, mixed with sand, the shores were generally strewn;
therefore they cast weapons of that sort to a greater distance,
with surer aim, and more powerful effect, than even the Balearian
slingers. Besides, their sling does not consist merely of a
single strap, like the Balearic and that of other nations, but the
thong of the sling is three-fold, and made firm by several seams,
that the bullet may not, by the yielding of the strap in the act of
throwing, be let fly at random, but after sticking fast while
whirled about, it may be discharged as if sent from the string of
a bow. Being accustomed to drive their bullets through circular
marks of small circumference, placed at a great distance, they
not only hit the enemy&#8217;s heads, but any part of their face that
they aimed at. These slings checked the Sam&aelig;ans from sallying
either so frequently or so boldly; insomuch that they would,
sometimes, from the walls, beseech the Ach&aelig;ans to retire for
a while, and be quiet spectators of their fight with the Roman
guards. Same supported a siege of four months. When
some of their small number were daily killed or wounded, and
the survivors were, through continual fatigues, greatly reduced
both in strength and spirits, the Romans, one night scaling
the wall of the citadel, which they call Cyatides, (for the city
sloping towards the sea verges towards the west,) made their
way into the forum. The Sam&aelig;ans, on discovering that a
part of the city was taken, fled, with their wives and children,
into the greater citadel; but submitting next day, they were
all sold as slaves, their city being plundered.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b30" name="b30"></a>30</span>
As soon as he had settled the affairs of Cephallenia, the
consul, leaving a garrison in Same, sailed over to Peloponnesus,
where the &AElig;gians and Laced&aelig;monians, chiefly, solicited
his presence for a long time. From the first institution of the
Ach&aelig;an council, the assemblies of the nation had been held
at &AElig;gium, whether that was conceded to the dignity of the
city, or the commodiousness of its situation. This usage Philop&#339;men
first attempted to subvert in that year, and determined
to introduce an ordinance, that these should be held in rotation
in every one of the cities, which were members of the Ach&aelig;an
union; and a little before the arrival of the consul, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1755" id="Page_1755">Pg 1755</a></span>
the Demiurguses, who are the chief magistrates in the states,
summoned the representatives to &AElig;gium, Philop&#339;men, then
pr&aelig;tor, by proclamation, appointed their meeting at Argos.
To which place when it was apparent that all would come, the
consul likewise, though he favoured the cause of the &AElig;gians,
went to Argos, but, after there had been a debate, and he
saw the scale turning against the &AElig;gians, he desisted from
his undertaking. The Laced&aelig;monians then drew his attention
to their disputes. The exiles especially kept that state
in alarm: of whom great numbers resided in the maritime
forts on the coast of Laconia, all which had been taken from
the Laced&aelig;monians. At this the Laced&aelig;monians were deeply
chagrined, and in order that they might have some where a free
access to the sea, if they should have occasion to send ambassadors
to Rome, or any other place, and at the same time possess
some mart and repository for foreign merchandise, for their
necessary demands, attacked in the night a maritime village
called Las, and seized it by surprise. The inhabitants, and
the exiles residing in the place, were terrified, at first, by the
sudden assault; but afterwards collecting in a body before
day, after a slight contest, they drove back the Laced&aelig;monians.
A general alarm, nevertheless, spread over the whole coast,
and all the forts and villages, with the exiles whose homes were
there, united in sending a common embassy to the Ach&aelig;ans.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b31" name="b31"></a>31</span>
The pr&aelig;tor, Philop&#339;men,&mdash;(who, from the beginning,
had ever been a friend to the cause of the exiles, and had always
advised the Ach&aelig;ans to reduce the power and influence
of the Laced&aelig;monians,)&mdash;gave an audience of the council to the
ambassadors while making their complaints. There, on a motion
made by him, a decree was passed, that, &#8220;whereas Titus
Quintius and the Romans had committed their forts and villages,
on the coast of Laconia, to the protection and guardianship
of the Ach&aelig;ans; and whereas the Laced&aelig;monians, according
to the treaty, ought to leave them unmolested; notwithstanding
which, the village of Las has been attacked by them
and bloodshed committed therein; therefore, unless the
authors and abettors of this outrage were delivered up to
the Ach&aelig;ans, the treaty would be considered as violated.&#8221;
To demand those persons, ambassadors were instantly despatched
to Laced&aelig;mon. This authoritative injunction appeared
to the Laced&aelig;monians so haughty and insolent, that if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1756" id="Page_1756">Pg 1756</a></span>
their state had been in its ancient condition, they would undoubtedly
have taken to arms. But they were principally
alarmed by apprehensions, lest, if by obeying the first mandates
they once received the yoke, Philop&#339;men should put
the exiles in possession of Laced&aelig;mon, a design which he had
been a long time planning. Maddened therefore with anger,
they put to death thirty men of the faction which had held
some correspondence with Philop&#339;men and the exiles, and
passed a decree, that the alliance with the Ach&aelig;ans should be
renounced, and that ambassadors should be sent immediately
to Cephallenia, to surrender Laced&aelig;mon to the consul Marcus
Fulvius and the Romans, and beseech him to come into Peloponnesus,
and to receive Laced&aelig;mon under the protection
and dominion of the Roman people.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b32" name="b32"></a>32</span>
When the Ach&aelig;an ambassadors returned with an account
of these proceedings, war was declared against the
Laced&aelig;monians, by a unanimous vote of all the states of the confederacy;
but the winter prevented its being commenced immediately.
However, the confines of the Laced&aelig;monians were
laid waste by small expeditions, more like freebooting than a
regular war, made not only by land, but also by ships at sea.
This commotion brought the consul into Peloponnesus, and,
by his order, a council being summoned at Elis, the Laced&aelig;monians
were called on to plead their own cause. There
were not only violent debates then, but even altercation. To
which, the consul, although his answer had been indecisive in
other respects, since he encouraged both parties through a very
eager desire to please, put an end, by one decisive order, that
they should desist from hostilities, until they sent ambassadors
to Rome, to the senate. An embassy was despatched by both
parties to Rome. The Laced&aelig;monian exiles intrusted their
cause and embassy to the Ach&aelig;ans. Diophanes and Lycortas,
both of them Megalopolitans, were at the head of the
Ach&aelig;an embassy, who, being at variance in their own republic,
there also delivered speeches by no means in unison.
Diophanes was for leaving the determination of every
point to the senate&mdash;that they would best decide the controversies
between the Ach&aelig;ans and Laced&aelig;monians; while Lycortas,
according to the instructions of Philop&#339;men, required,
that the senate should permit the Ach&aelig;ans to execute their
own decrees, made conformable to the treaty, and their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1757" id="Page_1757">Pg 1757</a></span>
laws; and that they should concede to them, uninfringed, the
liberty which they themselves had bestowed. The Ach&aelig;an nation
was, at that time, in high esteem with the Romans; yet
it was resolved, that no alteration should be made respecting
the Laced&aelig;monians; but the answer given was so confused,
that, while the Ach&aelig;ans understood it as full permission given
to them in relation to Laced&aelig;mon, the Laced&aelig;monians construed
it, that unlimited power was not conceded to them.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b33" name="b33"></a>33</span>
The Ach&aelig;ans used this power in an immoderate and
tyrannical manner. Philop&#339;men is continued in office, and
he, in the beginning of spring, collecting an army, encamped
in the territory of the Laced&aelig;monians, and thence
sent ambassadors to insist on their delivering up the authors
of the insurrection; promising, that if they complied, their
state should remain in peace, and that those persons should
not suffer any punishment, without having pleaded their
cause. There was silence among the rest through fear; but
the persons demanded by name, declared that they would
voluntarily go, if their faith was pledged by the ambassadors,
that violence would not be resorted to, until their cause were
heard. Several other men, of illustrious characters, went
along with them, both as supporters of those private individuals,
and because they thought their cause concerned the
public interest. The Ach&aelig;ans had never before brought the
Laced&aelig;monian exiles into the country, because they knew
that nothing would disgust the people so much; but now, the
vanguard of almost their whole army was composed of them.
When the Laced&aelig;monians came to the gate of the camp, these
men met them in a body, and, first, began to provoke them with
insulting language; a wrangle then ensuing, and their passions
being inflamed, the most furious of the exiles made an attack on
the Laced&aelig;monians. While these appealed to the gods, and
the faith of the ambassadors; and while the ambassadors and
the pr&aelig;tor were driving back the crowd, and protecting the Laced&aelig;monians,
and were keeping back some who were already
binding them in chains,&mdash;the multitude was increasing, owing
to a tumult having been excited. The Ach&aelig;ans, at first, ran
thither to view the spectacle; but then the exiles, with loud
clamours, complained of the sufferings that they had undergone,
implored assistance, and at the same time insisted, that they
would never have such an opportunity if they neglected this;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1758" id="Page_1758">Pg 1758</a></span>
that the treaties, solemnly ratified in the Capitol, at Olympia,
and in the citadel of Athens, had been rendered void by these
men; and that before they should be bound by a new treaty,
the guilty ought to be punished. The multitude being inflamed
by these expressions, at the voice of one who called
out that they should fall on, attacked them with stones; and
seventeen persons, who, during the disturbance, had been put
in chains, were killed. The next day, sixty-three, whom the
pr&aelig;tor had protected from violence, not because he wished
them safe, but because he was unwilling that they should perish
without a defence, being taken into custody, and brought
before an enraged multitude, after addressing a few words to
such prejudiced ears, were all condemned and executed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b34" name="b34"></a>34</span>
After this fear had been inspired, orders were sent to
the Laced&aelig;monians, first, that they should demolish their
walls; then, that all the foreign auxiliaries, who had served
for pay under the tyrants, should quit the Laconian territories;
then, that the slaves, whom the tyrants had set free,
who amounted to a great multitude, should depart before a
certain day; that the Ach&aelig;ans should be authorized to seize,
sell, and carry away those who might remain in the country.
That they should abrogate the laws and customs of Lycurgus,
and adopt the laws and institutions of the Ach&aelig;ans; that thus
all would become one body, and concord would be established
among them. They obeyed none of these injunctions more
willingly than that of demolishing the walls, nor suffered any
with more reluctance than the restoration of the exiles. A
decree for their restoration was made at Tegea, in a general
council of the Ach&aelig;ans; where, an account being brought,
that the foreign auxiliaries had been sent away, and that the
newly-registered Laced&aelig;monians (so they called the slaves
who were enfranchised by the tyrants) had left the city and
dispersed through the country, it was resolved, that, before
the army was disbanded, the pr&aelig;tor should go with some
light troops, and, seizing that description of people, sell them
as spoil. Great numbers were accordingly seized, and sold;
and with that money a portico at Megalopolis, which the
Laced&aelig;monians had demolished, was rebuilt, with the approbation
of the Ach&aelig;ans. The lands of Belbinis, of which
the Laced&aelig;monian tyrants had unjustly kept possession, were
also restored to that state, according to an old decree of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1759" id="Page_1759">Pg 1759</a></span>
Ach&aelig;ans, made in the reign of Philip, son of Amyntas. The
state of Laced&aelig;mon having, by these means, lost the sinews
of its strength, remained long in subjection to the Ach&aelig;ans;
but nothing hurt it so materially as the abolition of the discipline
of Lycurgus, in the practice of which they had continued
during seven hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b35" name="b35"></a>35</span>
After the sitting of the council, wherein the debate
between the Ach&aelig;ans and Laced&aelig;monians was held in presence
of the consul, as the year was expiring, Marcus Fulvius,
having gone home to Rome to hold the elections, appointed
Marcus Valerius Messala and Caius Livius Salinator
consuls, after having, this year, procured the rejection of his
enemy, Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus. Then Quintus Marcius
Philippus, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Caius Stertinius, Caius
Atinius, Publius Claudius Pulcher, and Lucius Manlius
Acidinus, were elected pr&aelig;tors. When the elections were
finished, it was resolved, that the consul, Marcus Fulvius,
should return into his province to the army; and to him and
his colleague, Cneius Manlius, their command was prolonged
for a year. In this year, in pursuance of directions from the
decemvirs, a statue of Hercules was set up in his temple, and
a gilded chariot with six horses were placed in the Capitol,
by Publius Cornelius. The inscription mentioned, that Publius
Cornelius, the consul,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> made the offering. Also twelve gilded
shields, out of money raised by fines on corn merchants, for
raising the market by hoarding the grain, were dedicated by
the curule &aelig;diles, Publius Claudius Pulcher and Servius Sulpicius
Galba; and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the plebeian &aelig;dile,
having convicted one malefactor, (for the &aelig;diles prosecuted separately,)
dedicated two gilded statues. His colleague, Aulus
C&aelig;cilius, did not convict any one. The Roman games were
exhibited thrice; the plebeian, five times altogether. Marcus
Valerius Messala, and Caius Livius Salinator, after entering
into office on the ides of March, consulted the senate concerning
the state of the commonwealth, the provinces, and
the armies. With respect to &AElig;tolia and Asia no alteration
was made. With regard to the consuls, to the one Pis&aelig;, with
the Ligurians, is decreed as his province; to the other, Gaul.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1760" id="Page_1760">Pg 1760</a></span>They were ordered to cast lots for these, or to settle the matter
between themselves, to enrol new armies, two legions for
each; and to levy off the allies of the Latin name, fifteen
thousand foot, and one thousand two hundred horse. Liguria
fell, by lot, to Messala; Gaul, to Salinator. The pr&aelig;tors
then cast lots, and the city jurisdiction fell to Marcus Claudius;
the foreign, to Publius Claudius. Quintus Marcius obtained,
by lot, Sicily; Caius Stertinius, Sardinia; Lucius
Manlius, Hither Spain; Caius Atinius, Farther Spain.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b36" name="b36"></a>36</span>
Respecting the armies, they passed the following resolutions&mdash;that
the legions which had served under Caius L&aelig;lius,
should be removed out of Gaul into Bruttium, to Marcus
Tuccius, the propr&aelig;tor; that the army which was in Sicily
should be disbanded, and that Marcus Sempronius, the propr&aelig;tor,
should bring back to Rome the fleet that was there. For
the Spains were decreed the legions then in those provinces, one
for each, with orders, that each of the two pr&aelig;tors should
levy from among the allies, as a reinforcement, three thousand
foot and two hundred horse, and bring them with them.
Before the new magistrates set out for their provinces, a supplication,
of three days&#8217; continuance, was ordered by the college
of decemvirs to be performed in every street, on account
of a darkness having overspread the light of day, between the
third and fourth hours; and the nine days&#8217; solemnity was
proclaimed, because there had been a shower of stones on the
Aventine. The Campanians, as the censors obliged them,
pursuant to the decree of the senate, made last year, to pass
the general survey at Rome, (for before that, it had not been
fixed where they should be surveyed,) petitioned that they
might be allowed to take in marriage women who were citizens
of Rome, and that any who had, heretofore, married such,
might retain them; and, likewise, that children born of such
marriages, before that day, might be legitimate, and entitled to
inherit; both which requests were obtained. Caius Valerius
Tappus, a tribune of the commons, proposed an order of the people
concerning the citizens of the free towns of Formi&aelig;, Fundi,
and Arpinum, that they should be invested with the right of
voting, for hitherto they had had the rights of citizenship without
the privilege of voting. When four tribunes of the commons
were protesting against the bill, because it was not made under
the direction of the senate, on being informed, that the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1761" id="Page_1761">Pg 1761</a></span>
of imparting the privilege of voting to any person they should
choose belonged to the people, and not to the senate, they desisted
from their opposition. An order was passed, that the
Formians and Fundans should vote in the &AElig;milian tribe, and
the Arpinians in the Cornelian; and in these tribes they were
then, for the first time, rated in the census, in pursuance of
the order of the people proposed by Valerius. Marcus Claudius
Marcellus, the censor, having got the better of Titus Quintius
in the lots, closed the lustrum. Two hundred and fifty-eight
thousand three hundred and eight citizens were rated.
When the lustrum was finished, the consuls set out for their
provinces.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b37" name="b37"></a>37</span>
During the winter wherein these acts were performed
at Rome, embassies from all the nations and states which
dwelt on this side of Mount Taurus, came together on all sides
to Cneius Manlius, at first consul, and afterwards proconsul,
passing the winter in Asia; and although the conquest of Antiochus
was more splendid and glorious to the Romans than
that of the Gauls, yet the latter gave greater joy to the allies
than the former. Subjection to the king had been more tolerable
to them than the savage nature of those wild barbarians,
and the daily alarm, with the uncertainty of the direction in
which the storm would, as it were, drift them in their desolating
path. Therefore since to them liberty was given by
the expulsion of Antiochus, and permanent peace by the conquest
of the Gauls, they brought, not only congratulations,
but also golden crowns, in proportion to the ability of each.
Ambassadors also came from Antiochus, and from the Gauls
themselves, that the conditions of peace might be dictated to
them; and from Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, to solicit
pardon, and make atonement, by money, for his crime in assisting
Antiochus with troops. Six hundred talents of silver
are levied off him. Answer was made to the Gauls, that
when king Eumenes arrived, he would settle the conditions.
The embassies of the several states were dismissed with kind
answers, much happier than when they arrived. The ambassadors
of Antiochus were ordered to bring the money and the
corn, (according to the treaty concluded with Lucius Scipio,)
into Pamphylia, whither the consul intended to go with his
forces. In the beginning of the next spring, after purifying
the army, he began his march, and on the eighth day arrived at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1762" id="Page_1762">Pg 1762</a></span>
Apamea. Having halted there during three days, he, on the
third day after his departure from that place, arrived in Pamphylia,
to which place he had ordered the king&#8217;s ambassadors to
bring together the money and corn. Two thousand five hundred
talents<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> of silver, being received by him, were conveyed
to Apamea; the corn was distributed among the army. Thence
he marched to Perga, the only place in the country still held
by a garrison of the king&#8217;s troops. On his approach, the
governor of the town met him, and requested thirty days&#8217;
time, that he might consult Antiochus about the surrender of
the city. The time being granted, on the appointed day
the garrison evacuated the city. From Perga, he detached
his brother, Lucius Manlius, with four thousand men, to
Oroanda, to exact from that town the remainder of the money
which they had promised; and, having ordered the ambassadors
of Antiochus to follow, he led back his army to Apamea,
because he heard that king Eumenes, and the ten ambassadors
from Rome, were arrived at Ephesus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b38" name="b38"></a>38</span>
Then, with the concurrence of the ten ambassadors, a
treaty was concluded with Antiochus, in nearly the following
words: &#8220;Let there be friendship between king Antiochus and
the Roman people, on the following terms and conditions&mdash;Let
not the king suffer any army, intended to act against the Roman
people, or their allies, to pass through the territories of his
own realm, or of any state under his dominion, nor supply it
with provisions, or with any other assistance. Let the Romans
and their allies observe the same conduct toward Antiochus,
and those under his government. Let there not be to Antiochus
the right of carrying on war with the inhabitants of
the islands, or of passing over into Europe. Let him evacuate
the cities, lands, villages, and forts on this side of Mount
Taurus, as far as the river Halys; and from the foot of Mount
Taurus to the summit, where it verges upon Lycaonia. Let him
not remove any arms out of those towns, lands, or forts which
he may evacuate; if he hath removed any, let him honourably
replace what he ought to make good, and in the place that he
ought. Let him not receive any soldier, or other person, from
the kingdom of Eumenes. If any natives of those cities, which
are hereby separated from his kingdom, are now with Antiochus,
or within the bounds of his realms, let them all return to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1763" id="Page_1763">Pg 1763</a></span>Apamea, before a certain day. Let such of the natives of Antiochus&#8217;s
kingdom, as are now with the Romans and their allies,
have liberty to depart or to stay. Let him deliver to the Romans
and their allies, all their slaves, whether fugitives or taken in
war, likewise whatever free-born person may be a prisoner or
deserter. Let him give up all his elephants, and not procure
others. Let him also surrender his ships of war, and their
stores; let him not keep more than ten light trading vessels,
none of which are to be worked with more than thirty oars,
nor a galley of one tier of oars, for the purpose of an offensive
war; let him not ail on this side of the promontories, Calycadnus
and Sarpedon, except in a ship which will carry money,
tribute, ambassadors, or hostages. Let there not be to king
Antiochus the right of hiring soldiers out of those nations
which are under the dominion of the Roman people, nor of
receiving volunteers. Whatever houses and buildings, within
the limits of Antiochus&#8217;s kingdom, belong to the Rhodians
and their allies, let them belong to the Rhodians and allies
on the same footing as they did before the war. If any sums
of money are due to them, let them have a right to enforce
payment; likewise, if any of their property has been taken
away, let them have a right to search for, discover, and reclaim
it. If any persons, to whom Antiochus hath given the cities
which ought to be surrendered, still hold them, let him remove
the garrisons, and take care that they may be properly surrendered.
Let him pay, within twelve years, by equal annual
payments, twelve thousand Attic talents of silver,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the talent
to weigh not less than eighty Roman pounds; and five hundred
and forty thousand pecks of wheat. He shall pay to
king Eumenes, within five years, three hundred and fifty
talents;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and, for the corn due, the sum which arises from his
own valuation, one hundred and twenty seven talents.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Let
him deliver to the Romans twenty hostages, and change them
every third year; none of which are to be younger than eighteen,
or older than forty-five years. If any of the allies of
the Roman people shall make war on Antiochus, let him have
liberty to repel force by force, provided he does not keep possession
of any city, either by right of arms, or by admitting
it into a treaty of amity. Let them decide the controversies
among themselves by equity and arbitration; or, if it shall be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1764" id="Page_1764">Pg 1764</a></span>the choice of both parties, by arms.&#8221; A clause was added to
this treaty also, about delivering up Hannibal the Carthaginian,
Thoas the &AElig;tolian, Mnasimachus the Acarnanian, and the
Chalcidians Eubalidas and Philo; and another, that if it should
afterwards please the parties that any thing should be added,
cancelled, or altered, that it might be done without invalidating
the treaty.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b39" name="b39"></a>39</span>
The consul swore to the observance of this treaty.
Quintus Minucius Thermus and Lucius Manlius, who happened
to return just at that time from Oroanda, went to require
the oath of the king. At the same time he wrote to
Quintus Fabius Labeo, commander of the fleet, to sail, without
delay, to Patara, to break up and burn the king&#8217;s ships that lay
there. Sailing, accordingly, from Ephesus, he broke up or
burned fifty decked ships; and, in the same voyage, took Telmessus,
the inhabitants being terrified by his sudden appearance.
Then having ordered those who were left at Ephesus
to follow him, he passed onward from Lycia, through the islands
to Greece. At Athens, after waiting a few days,
until the ships from Ephesus came to Pir&aelig;eus, he then brought
home the whole fleet to Italy. Cneius Manlius, when he had,
among other matters to be given up by Antiochus, received
his elephants, and given them all as a present to Eumenes,
then examined the causes of the several states, since many had
been thrown into confusion amid the violent changes. King
Ariarathes, the half of the money levied on him being remitted,
through the kind offices of Eumenes, to whom he had
betrothed, during that time, his daughter, was received into
friendship. The ten ambassadors, after examining the causes
of the respective states, made different arrangements, in different
cases. They gave independence to those which had
been tributary to king Antiochus and had sided with the Romans;
and they ordered all such as had taken part with Antiochus,
or had been tributary to king Attalus, to pay tribute
to Eumenes. Besides they granted independence to the Colophonians,
who live in Notium, the Cym&aelig;ans, and Milasenians,
all of whom they specified by name. To the Clazomenians
they gave, besides their independence, the island of Drymusa.
To the Milesians they restored what was called the sacred
lands. They added to the territory of the Trojans, Rh&#339;teum
and Gergithus, not so much in consideration of any recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1765" id="Page_1765">Pg 1765</a></span>
merits of theirs, as out of respect to their own origin. The
same motive was the reason of their liberating Dardanum.
They gifted the Chians, also the Smyrn&aelig;ans and Erythr&aelig;ans,
with lands, in consideration of the singular fidelity which they
displayed during the war, and treated them with every distinguished
honour. To the Phoc&aelig;ans, the territory which
they had enjoyed before the war was restored; and permission
was given them to use their ancient laws. They confirmed
to the Rhodians the grants which were mentioned in
the former decree. Lycia and Caria were assigned to them
as far as the river M&aelig;ander, excepting Telmessus. To king
Eumenes they gave, in Europe, the Chersonese and Lysimachia,
with the forts, towns, and lands thereof, with the same
frontier as Antiochus had held them; and, in Asia, both the
Phrygias, the one on the Hellespont, and the other called the
Greater, and restored to him Mysia, which had been taken by
king Prusias, and also gave to him Lycaonia, and Milyas, and
Lydia, and, by express mention, the cities of Tralles, and
Ephesus, and Telmessus. When a dispute had arisen between
Eumenes and Antiochus&#8217;s ambassadors, concerning Pamphylia,
because part of it lay on the hither side, and part on the further
side of Taurus, the matter was referred wholly to the senate.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b40" name="b40"></a>40</span>
When these treaties and grants were concluded, Manlius,
with the ten ambassadors, and all his army, marched to
the Hellespont, and dictated to the chiefs of the Gauls, whom
he had summoned thither, terms on which they should maintain
peace with Eumenes; and warned them to put an end to
the practice of straggling in arms, and to confine themselves
within the bounds of their own territories. Then, having
collected ships from all parts of the coast, and Eumenes&#8217;s fleet
also being brought thither from El&aelig;a by Athen&aelig;us, that
king&#8217;s brother, he transported all his forces into Europe. Then
leading slowly through the Chersonese, by short marches, the
army heavily encumbered with booty of every sort, he halted
at Lysimachia; in order that he might enter Thrace, the
march through which they in general dreaded, with the beasts
of burden as fresh and vigorous as possible. On the day
in which he set out from Lysimachia, he came to the river
which they call Melas,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and thence, next day, to Cypsela. The
road, about ten miles from Cypsela, proved to be obstructed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1766" id="Page_1766">Pg 1766</a></span>by woods, narrow and broken. On account of these difficulties
he divided the army into two parts; and, ordering one
to advance in front, and the other at a considerable distance,
to cover the rear, he placed between them the baggage; it
was composed of waggons with the public money, and other
booty of great value. As he was marching in this order
through the defile, a body of Thracians, not more in number
than ten thousand, composed of four states, the Astians,
C&aelig;nians, Maduatians, and Corelians, posted themselves on
both sides of the road at the narrowest part. There was an
opinion that this was not done without the treacherous connivance
of Philip, king of Macedonia; that he knew that the
Romans would return by no other route than that through
Thrace, and what an immense sum they would carry with
them. The general himself was in the van, anxious about
the disadvantages of the ground. The Thracians did not
stir until the troops passed by; but, when they saw that the
foremost division had got clear of the narrow pass, and that
the rear division was not yet drawing near, they rushed upon
the encumbrances and the baggage, and after killing the guards,
some rifled the waggons, while others led off the horses under
their loads. After their shouts reached those on the rear,
who were then just entering the pass, and afterwards those
in the van, the Romans ran together from both extremities
to the centre, and an irregular sort of fight commenced, in
many different places at once. The booty itself exposed the
Thracians to slaughter, as they were encumbered with burdens,
and most of them had thrown away their arms, that
they might have their hands disengaged for plundering; the
disadvantageous nature of the ground militated against the
Romans, as the barbarians attacked them through well-known
paths, and sometimes lurked in the ravines. The loads too,
and the waggons, lying incommodiously for one party or the
other, as chance directed, were great obstructions to their
movements; and here the plunderer, there the defender of
the booty, fell. The fortune of the fight was variable, according
as the ground was favourable or unfavourable to this
party or that, and according to the spirit of the combatants,
and their numbers, for some had come in contact with a
stronger party than themselves, others with a weaker. On
both sides, however, great numbers fell. The night was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1767" id="Page_1767">Pg 1767</a></span>
approaching, when the Thracians retired from the fight, not
for the purpose of avoiding wounds or death, but because
they had got enough of booty.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b41" name="b41"></a>41</span>
The first division of the Romans encamped beyond the
pass, in open ground, round the temple of Bendis;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> the second
division remained in the middle of the defile, surrounded by
a double rampart, to guard the baggage. Next day, having
carefully examined the ground before they put themselves in
motion, they rejoined the first. In that battle, although part
of the baggage was lost, while a great part of the attendants
and many of the soldiers perished, (since the fight was carried
on through almost the whole extent of the defile,) yet the
heaviest loss sustained was in the death of Quintus Minucius
Thermus, a brave and gallant officer. The army arrived that
day at the Hebrus, and thence passed through the country of
the &AElig;nians, by the temple of Apollo, whom the natives call
Zerynthius. Another defile, as rugged and uneven as the
former, awaits them around Tempyra (this is the name of the
place); but, as there were no woods near, it afforded no cover
for an ambuscade. Hither assembled the Thrausians, (who
are also a Thracian tribe,) with the same hope of plunder;
but because the bare valleys had this effect, that they were
visible at a distance besetting the defile, there was less terror
and tumult among the Romans; for, although they were
obliged to fight on disadvantageous ground, yet it was in a
regular battle, in an open field, and a fair encounter. Advancing
in close order, with the war-shout, and falling on the
enemy, they soon drove them off the ground, and put them
to flight. Afterwards the rout and massacre began to take
place, for the narrow passes actually impeded them. The victorious
Romans encamped at a village of the Maronites, called
Sare. Next day, after marching through an open country,
the plain of Priate received them, where they halted three
days, to receive supplies of corn, partly from the country of
the Maronites, who made a voluntary contribution, and partly
from their own ships, which attended them with stores of
every kind. From this post there was one day&#8217;s march to
Apollonia, whence they proceeded through the territory of
Abdera to Neapolis. All this march through the Grecian
colonies was performed in security. The rest of their march
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1768" id="Page_1768">Pg 1768</a></span>through the midst of the Thracians, though not harassed, was
full of apprehension, by day and night, until they arrived in
Macedon. This same army, when it proceeded by the same
route under Scipio, had found the Thracians more peaceable,
but for no other reason, than because it had then less booty,
which was the object of their attack: although Claudius writes,
that even on that occasion, a body of fifteen thousand Thracians
opposed Mutines, the Numidian, who had advanced to reconnoitre
the country. That the Numidians were four hundred
horsemen, and a few elephants. That the son of Mutines, with
a hundred and fifty chosen horsemen, broke through the middle
of the enemy; and that the same individual, presently, when
Mutines, placing his elephants in the centre, and the horse on
the wings, had begun to engage the enemy, cast terror into
them by an attack on their rear; and that owing to this, the
enemy, routed by the storm, as it were, of cavalry, did not
come near the main body of infantry. Cneius Manlius conducted
his army through Macedon into Thessaly; and,
having proceeded, through Epirus to Apollonia, passed the
winter there, as the sea in the winter was not as yet considered
so little formidable that he might venture on the
passage.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b42" name="b42"></a>42</span>
It was almost at the expiration of the year, that the
consul, Marcus Valerius, came from Liguria to Rome to elect
new magistrates, although he had not performed in his
province any memorable act that could afford a reasonable
excuse for coming later than usual to the elections. The
assembly for choosing the consuls was held on the twelfth day
before the calends of March. Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus and
Caius Flaminius were elected consuls. The following day,
Appius Claudius Pulcher, Servius Sulpicius Galba, Quintus
Terentius Culleo, Lucius Terentius Massa, Quintus Fulvius
Flaccus, and Marcus Furius Crassipes were elected pr&aelig;tors.
When the elections were concluded, the consul asked the
senate what were the provinces that they wished should be
given to the prætors: they decreed two for the administration
of justice in Rome; two out of Italy&mdash;Sicily and Sardinia; and
two in Italy&mdash;Tarentum and Gaul: the pr&aelig;tors were ordered
to cast lots immediately, before they entered on their office.
Servius Sulpicius received by lot the city jurisdiction; Quintus
Terentius, the foreign; Lucius Terentius obtained Sicily;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1769" id="Page_1769">Pg 1769</a></span>
Quintus Fulvius, Sardinia; Appius Claudius, Tarentum; and
Marcus Furius, Gaul. In that year, Lucius Minucius Myrtilus
and Lucius Manlius, as they were charged with having
beaten the Carthaginian ambassadors, were, by order of
Marcus Claudius, city pr&aelig;tor, delivered up by heralds to the
ambassadors, and carried to Carthage. Reports prevailed of
a great war, growing too every day more formidable, in Liguria.
The senate, therefore, decreed Liguria as the province
of both the new consuls, on the day that they made their
motion in the senate concerning the republic and the provinces.
To this vote the consul, Lepidus, objected, asserting
that &#8220;it would be highly indecorous to shut up the consuls
among the valleys of Liguria, while Marcus Fulvius and
Cneius Manlius reigned, a second year, one in Europe, another
in Asia, as if substituted in the room of Philip and Antiochus.
If it was resolved to keep armies in those countries,
it was more fitting that consuls, rather than private persons,
should have the command of them. That they made their circuits
with all the terrors of war, among nations against whom
war had not been declared, trafficking peace for money. If it
was necessary to hold these provinces with armies, in the same
manner as Lucius Scipio, consul, had succeeded Manius Acilius,
consul; and as Marcus Fulvius and Cneius Manlius succeeded
Lucius Scipio; so ought Caius Livius and Marcus Valerius, the
consuls, to have succeeded Fulvius and Manlius. But, unquestionably,
at this time, after the &AElig;tolian war had been concluded,
Asia taken from Antiochus, and the Gauls subdued,&mdash;either
the consuls ought to be sent to the consular armies,
or the legions ought be brought home, and restored to the
commonwealth.&#8221; The senate, although they heard these
words, persisted in their vote, that Liguria should be the province
of both the consuls; but they ordered, that Manlius and
Fulvius should leave their provinces, withdraw the troops,
and come home to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b43" name="b43"></a>43</span>
There was a quarrel between Marcus Fulvius and the
consul &AElig;milius; and in addition to other motives, &AElig;milius
thought, that he had been made consul two years later, by
the opposition of Marcus Fulvius. In order, therefore, to exasperate
the minds of the public against him, he introduced
to the senate ambassadors from Ambracia, whom he had secretly
instructed in the charges they were to make against him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1770" id="Page_1770">Pg 1770</a></span>
These complained, that &#8220;war had been made on them when
they were in a state of peace, after they had executed the
commands of former consuls, and were ready to show the
same obedience to Marcus Fulvius; that first their lands were
ravaged; and that, the terror of rapine and carnage was then
cast into the city, that by that fear they might be compelled
to shut their gates. They were then besieged and assaulted,
and all the horrors of war were inflicted on them, murders,
burnings, the sacking and demolishing of their city. Their
wives and children were dragged away into slavery; their
goods taken from them; and, what shocked them more than
all, their temples were despoiled of their ornaments, and the
images of their gods, nay, the gods themselves were torn
from their mansions, and carried away; so that the Ambracians
had nothing left to adore, to which they could address
their prayers and supplications, but naked walls and pillars.&#8221;
While they were making these complaints, the consul, as
had been agreed, by asking questions leading to further
charges, drew them on, as if against their inclinations, to
the mention of other matters. The senators being moved
by these accusations, the other consul, Caius Flaminius, took
up the cause of Marcus Fulvius: and he said that &#8220;the
Ambracians had set out in an old course, now long out of
use. In this manner Marcus Marcellus had been accused
by the Syracusans; and Quintus Fulvius by the Campanians.
Why might not the senate as well allow Titus Quintius
to be accused by king Philip; Manius Acilius and Lucius
Scipio, by Antiochus; Cneius Manlius, by the Gauls; and
Fulvius himself, by the &AElig;tolians and the states of Cephallenia?
Do you think, conscript fathers, either that I in
behalf of Marcus Fulvius, or that Marcus Fulvius himself, will
deny the besieging and taking Ambracia, the removing thence
the statues and ornaments, and the other proceedings, which
are usual on the capture of cities? He is about to demand
a triumph from you for those very services, and to carry before
his chariot those statues, the removal of which is charged as
criminal, together with the other spoils of that city, and hang
them up on the pillars of his house. There is no kind of pretence
for their separating themselves from the &AElig;tolians; the
cause of the Ambracians and of the &AElig;tolians is the same. Let,
therefore, my colleague either vent his malice in some other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1771" id="Page_1771">Pg 1771</a></span>
case; or, if he is determined to proceed in this, let him detain
his Ambracians until Fulvius comes home. I will not suffer
any determination, concerning either the Ambracians or
&AElig;tolians, to pass in the absence of Marcus Fulvius.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b44" name="b44"></a>44</span>
When &AElig;milius inveighed against the artful malignity
of his adversary as being notorious to all, and affirmed, that he
would spin out the time by affecting delays, so as not to return
to Rome while an adversary was consul; two days were
wasted in this dispute, and it was apparent that while Flaminius
was present, no decision of the cause could be procured.
The opportunity was eagerly caught at by &AElig;milius, when
Flaminius, happening to fall sick, was absent, and on his proposing
the motion the senate decreed, that, &#8220;all their effects
should be restored to the Ambracians, that they should enjoy
liberty, and the benefit of their own laws, and should levy
what duties they might think proper on goods conveyed by
land or sea, provided that the Romans and the allies of the
Latin nation should be exempted therefrom. That with respect
to the statues, and other ornaments, which they complained
were carried away from their sacred buildings, their order
was, that immediately on the return of Marcus Fulvius to
Rome, the business should be laid before the college of pontiffs,
and that whatever they might think proper should be
done.&#8221; Nor was the consul content with this; but afterwards,
in a badly attended meeting, he procured a clause to be added
to the decree, &#8220;that it did not appear that Ambracia was
taken by force.&#8221; A supplication of three days&#8217; continuance
was then performed for the health of the people, because a
grievous pestilence was desolating the city and country. The
Latin festival was afterwards celebrated, when the consuls,
being relieved from these religious duties, and having finished
their levies, (for both of them chose to employ new soldiers,)
set out for their provinces, where they disbanded all the old
troops.</p>

<p>Shortly after the departure of the consuls, Cneius Manlius,
the proconsul, arrived at Rome; and, when an audience of
the senate was granted to him in the temple of Bellona, by
Servius Sulpicius, the pr&aelig;tor, after enumerating the services
which he had performed, he demanded that, in consideration
thereof, public thanks should be offered to the immortal gods,
and permission be granted to himself, to ride through the city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1772" id="Page_1772">Pg 1772</a></span>
in triumph; the greater number of the ten ambassadors, who
had been in the province along with him, opposed the grant,
and particularly Lucius Furius Purpureo, and Lucius &AElig;milius
Paulus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b45" name="b45"></a>45</span>
They alleged that &#8220;they had been appointed
ambassadors in conjunction with Manlius, to make peace with
Antiochus, and to conclude the terms of the treaty which had
been entered on with Lucius Scipio. That Cneius Manlius
laboured to the utmost of his power, to confound this peace,
and to seize Antiochus by treachery, if he should put his person
in the consul&#8217;s power; but that he (Antiochus) having discovered
the treacherous designs of the consul, though frequently
tempted by proposals of a conference, had not only avoided
the meeting, but even the sight of him. That Manlius, desiring
to cross Mount Taurus, was with difficulty restrained
by the entreaties of all the ambassadors, who besought him not
to brave the curse denounced in the Sibylline verses against
such as should pass those fatal limits. Nevertheless, he
marched his army thither, and encamped almost on the very
summit where the waters take opposite directions. As he
could find no sort of pretence for hostilities, the king&#8217;s subjects
being perfectly quiet, he led his army round to the Gallogr&aelig;cians,
against which nation war was waged, without any
decree of the senate, or order of the people. Which did ever
any general before presume to do in like manner, on his own
judgment? The latest wars were those with Antiochus, with
Philip, and with Hannibal and the Carthaginians; concerning
all these the senate had passed its decrees, the people their
orders; several embassies were previously sent; restitution
demanded; and, finally, heralds were sent to proclaim war.
Now, Cneius Manlius,&#8221; said they, &#8220;has any one of these proceedings
been observed in the present case, that we should
consider it a war of the Roman people, and not a predatory
expedition of your own contrivance? But, were you even
content with this? Did you lead your army against those
whom you had chosen to consider as enemies, by the direct
course; or did you ramble through every deflection of the
roads, when you stopped at every division of the way, in order
that, to whatever side Eumenes&#8217;s brother, Attalus, should turn
his route, you the consul, as an auxiliary in his pay, might
follow with a Roman army? Did you not traverse every recess
and corner of Pisidia, Lycaonia, and Phrygia; levying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1773" id="Page_1773">Pg 1773</a></span>
contributions from the tyrants and peasants in those remote
regions? For, what had you to do with the Oroandians, what
with other states equally inoffensive?</p>

<p>&#8220;But, in what manner did you conduct this war, on the
merit of which you ask a triumph? Did you fight on equal
ground, and at the time of your own choosing? Indeed you
with propriety require that thanks be returned to the immortal
gods; first, because they did not ordain that the army
should undergo the penalty deserved by the temerity of its
commander, in commencing a war in accordance with no law
of nations; and next, because they gave us, for antagonists,
brutes, and not men.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b46" name="b46"></a>46</span>
&#8220;Do not suppose that the name only
of the Gallogr&aelig;cians is a mixed one: their bodies, and their
minds, have undergone a similar process, and have been corrupted
by the mixture. Had they been such Gauls as those
whom we have a thousand times encountered in Italy, with
various success, would any one of us, considering the conduct
of our commander, have returned to tell the story? Two
battles were fought; twice he sustained the disadvantages of
position, and, at the bottom of a valley, almost placed his army
under the feet of the enemy; so that they were able to overwhelm
us, even though they did not cast their weapons from
the higher ground, but merely threw themselves on us without
arms. What, then, was the consequence? Great is the fortune
of the Roman people; great and terrible its name! By the
recent downfall of Hannibal, Philip, and Antiochus, the Gauls
were, in a manner, thunderstruck. Bulky as their bodies were,
they were dismayed, and put to flight, by slings and arrows;
not a sword was stained in battle during the Gallic war.
Like flocks of birds, they flew away at the very sound of
our missiles. But, indeed, when we, the same army, were on
our return, and happened to fall in with a party of Thracian
robbers, (as if fortune meant to teach us what the issue would
have been, if we had met an enemy,) we were beaten, routed,
and stripped of our baggage. Among many other brave
soldiers fell Quintus Minucius Thermus, whose death was a
much greater loss, than if Cneius Manlius, to whose rashness
the misfortune had happened, had perished. An army, carrying
home the spoils of king Antiochus, was dispersed in
three places, and with the vanguard in one place, the rear in
another, and the baggage in a third, hid itself for a night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1774" id="Page_1774">Pg 1774</a></span>
among bushes, in the dens of wild beasts. Is a triumph
demanded for such exploits as these? Although no disaster
and disgrace had been suffered in Thrace, over what enemies
would you triumph? Over those, I suppose, whom the Roman
senate or people had assigned to you as your enemies. On
these grounds, indeed, a triumph was granted to Lucius Scipio;
to Manius Acilius, over king Antiochus; to Titus Quintius,
over king Philip; and to Publius Africanus, over Hannibal,
the Carthaginians, and Syphax. Now, after the senate had
voted a declaration of war, the following unimportant matters
were inquired into:&mdash;To whom the declaration ought to be
made; whether to the kings in person, or whether making it at
some of their garrisons were sufficient? Do you wish, then,
that all these rites should be disregarded and profaned? That
the laws of the heralds be abrogated? That there should be
no heralds? Let religion (the gods pardon the expression) be
thrown aside; let forgetfulness of the gods occupy your
minds. Do you, also, judge it fit that the senate should not
be consulted concerning war? That the people should not
be asked, whether they choose and order war to be made on
the Gauls? On a late occasion, the consuls, certainly, wished
for the provinces of Greece and Asia; yet, when you persisted
in assigning Liguria as their province, they obeyed your
commands. They will, therefore, if the war should be successfully
carried on, justly demand a triumph from you, conscript
fathers, under whose authority they carried it on.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b47" name="b47"></a>47</span>
Such were the arguments of Furius and &AElig;milius.
We have heard that Maulius replied in nearly the following
manner: &#8220;Conscript fathers, formerly the tribunes of the
people were accustomed to oppose generals demanding a
triumph. I am thankful to the present tribunes because they
have conceded so much either to me, or to the greatness
of my services, as not only to show, by their silence, their
approbation of my pretensions to that honour, but likewise
their readiness, if there were occasion, to make a motion
to that purpose. I have, since it is the pleasure of the
gods, as my opponents some of the ten ambassadors, the
actual council which our ancestors assigned to generals for the
purpose of arranging their conquests and gracing their
victories. Lucius Furius and Lucius &AElig;milius forbid me to
mount the triumphal chariot, and pluck from my head the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1775" id="Page_1775">Pg 1775</a></span>
crown of glory, the persons whom, if the tribunes had opposed
triumph, I should have cited as witnesses to bear testimony
to my services. Conscript fathers, I envy no man&#8217;s
honours; but, on a late occasion, you yourselves deterred by
your authority the tribunes of the people, brave and active
men, from impeding the triumph of Quintus Fabius Labeo.
Fabius enjoyed a triumph; and yet his adversaries alleged,
not that he had carried on an unjust war, but that he had not
seen the enemy at all. Whereas I, who fought so many
pitched battles with one hundred thousand of your fiercest
enemies; who killed or made prisoners more than forty thousand;
who stormed two of their camps; who left all the
countries on this side of the summits of Taurus in greater
tranquillity than is the country of Italy; am not only defrauded
of a triumph, but obliged to plead my cause before
you, conscript fathers, whilst my own council of ambassadors
accuse me. Conscript fathers, their charge, as you perceive,
is twofold: for they assert, that I ought not to have waged war
with the Gauls; and besides, that the war was carried on rashly
and imprudently. The Gauls were not enemies; but, you committed
hostilities against them, when peaceable and obedient to
your orders. I am not about to require from you, conscript
fathers, that you may attribute to the Gauls who inhabit Asia,
those characteristics which you are well aware belong to the
Gallic race in general, savage fierceness and most inveterate
hatred to the name of Rome. Excluding the infamous and
odious character of the whole nation, judge of these Gauls by
themselves. I wish king Eumenes, I wish all the states of
Asia were present, and that you heard their complaints,
rather than my charges against them. Send ambassadors
round all the cities of Asia, and ask whether they were relieved
from more grievous servitude by the removal of Antiochus
beyond the summits of Taurus, or by the conquest of
the Gauls. Let them tell you how often their territories
were ravaged, how often their property and their people were
carried off as prey; while they had scarcely ever an opportunity
of ransoming any prisoners, they heard of nothing but
human victims slain, and their children offered up in sacrifice.
Be assured that your allies paid tribute to these Gauls; and,
though delivered now by you from the yoke of Antiochus,
must still have continued to pay it, if I had been inactive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1776" id="Page_1776">Pg 1776</a></span>
The farther Antiochus was removed, the more tyrannically
would the Gauls have domineered in Asia; and all the countries
on this side of Taurus you would have annexed to their
empire, not to your own.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b48" name="b48"></a>48</span>
&#8220;But, allowing all this to be so; the Gauls formerly
sacked Delphi, the common oracle to which all mankind resort,
and the central point of the globe of the earth; yet the
Roman people did not, on that account, proclaim or wage war
against them. I really thought, that there was some distinction
to be made between that period when Greece and
Asia were not yet under your jurisdiction and dominion, and
the present, when you have made Mount Taurus the boundary
of the Roman empire; when you grant liberty and independence
to the states of that country; when you augment
the territories of some; amerce others in a part of their
lands; impose tribute; add to, diminish, give, and take away
kingdoms, and deem it your business to take care that they
may enjoy peace both on land and sea. Is it not the case that
you would not have thought Asia liberated unless Antiochus
withdrew his garrisons, which lay quiet in their citadels: if
the armies of the Gauls roamed about without control, would
the grants which you made to king Eumenes be secure, or the
liberty of the states entire? But why do I reason thus? as if
I had not found the Gauls enemies, but made them such! I
appeal to you, Lucius Scipio, whose bravery and good fortune
alike I suppliantly sought, and not in vain, from the immortal
gods, when I succeeded you in the command; and to
you, Publius Scipio, who held, both with your brother the
consul, and with the army, the commission of a lieutenant-general
and the dignity of a colleague; did you ascertain that
legions of the Gauls were in the army of Antiochus? Did you
see them in his line of battle, posted in both wings; for there
was his main strength? Did you fight with them as declared
enemies? Did you kill them? Did you carry off their spoils?
Yet the senate had decreed, and the people ordered, war
against Antiochus, not against the Gauls. But as I judge,
they had at the same time decreed and ordered that war
should be with all those who should be reckoned among his
troops; so that, excepting Antiochus, with whom Scipio had
negotiated a peace, and with whom, specifying him by name,
you had directed a treaty to be concluded, every one who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1777" id="Page_1777">Pg 1777</a></span>
borne arms on the side of Antiochus against us, were our
enemies. And although the Gauls had been conspicuous in
that cause, and several petty princes and tyrants also; nevertheless,
I made peace with the rest, after compelling them to
atone for their transgressions, as the dignity of your empire
required. I made trial, at the same time, of the temper of
the Gauls, whether they could be reclaimed from their natural
ferocity; but, perceiving them untractable and implacable, I
then judged it necessary to chastise them by force of arms.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b49" name="b49"></a>49</span>
&#8220;Now, since the charge respecting the undertaking of
the war has been fully refuted, I must account for my conduct
in the prosecution of it. In which, indeed, I should
perfectly confide in the merits of my cause, though I were
pleading, not before a Roman, but before a Carthaginian senate,
by whom their commanders are said to be crucified, if
they act on wrong plans, even with success. But in such a
state as this, which, in the commencement and progress of
every undertaking, makes application to the gods on this
account, because it subjects to no malicious cavilling those
plans of which the gods have approved; and which, in the
established form, when it decrees a supplication or triumph,
uses these words,&mdash;&#8216;For having conducted the business of
the public successfully and fortunately;&#8217; if I should be unwilling,
if I should think it presumptuous and arrogant to
boast of my own bravery, and if I should demand, in consideration
of my own good fortune, and that of my army, in
having vanquished so great a nation, without any loss of men,
that thanks should be given to the immortal gods, and that
I should ascend the Capitol in triumph, from whence I took
my departure, with vows duly offered;&mdash;would you refuse
this to me, and the immortal gods? Yes; for I fought on
unfavourable ground. Tell me, then, on what more favourable
ground could I have fought, when the enemy had seized
on a mountain, and kept themselves in a strong post; surely,
if I wished to conquer them, I must go where they were.
What if they had a town on the same spot, and kept within
the walls: surely they must be attacked. Did Manlius Acilius
fight with Antiochus, at Thermopyl&aelig; on favourable ground?
Did not Titus Quintius dislodge Philip when he was posted
in the same manner, on the tops of mountains, over the river
Anio*? Truly I cannot yet discover what sort of an enemy they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1778" id="Page_1778">Pg 1778</a></span>
may represent to themselves, or in what light they may wish
them to appear to you. If as being degenerate and softened
by the pleasures of Asia, what danger was there in advancing
against them even on unfavourable ground? If formidable,
both for fierceness of courage and strength of body, do you
refuse a triumph to victories so honourable? Conscript fathers,
envy is blind, and only capable of depreciating merit,
and poisoning its honours and rewards. Pardon me, I beseech
you, conscript fathers, on these conditions, if it be the
case that the necessary reply to the accusation, and not my
desire of boasting of my exploits, hath made my speech too
long. Whether could I, in my march through Thrace, create
open glades out of narrow defiles, and level plains out of steep
precipices, and fields out of woods, and insure that the Thracian
plunderers should not lurk any where in those concealments
which they were acquainted with; that none of our
packages should be snatched away, none of our loaded horses,
out of so large a train, led off; that no one should be
wounded; and that the brave and active Lucius Minucius
should not die of his wound? On this mischance, by which
we unfortunately lost so valuable a citizen, those men declaim
profusely. That the enemy attacked us in a dangerous pass,
where every advantage of ground was against us; that our
two divisions, the front and the rear, surrounded by a combined
movement the army of the barbarians, while they were employed
about our baggage; that they killed and took prisoners
many thousands on that day; and, in a few days after, many
more;&mdash;do they imagine that you would not ascertain this,
even if they passed it over in silence, when the whole army
can testify the truth of what I assert? If I had never drawn
a sword in Asia, if I had never seen an enemy there, yet, by
the two battles fought in Thrace, I had merited a triumph,
as proconsul. But I have said enough, and shall only request,
and, I should hope, obtain, your pardon, conscript fathers, for
having troubled you longer than I could have wished to do.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b50" name="b50"></a>50</span>
The accusations that day would have been more powerful
than the defence, had they not prolonged the debate to a
late hour; for the senate adjourned in a mood likely to
refuse the triumph. Next day the relations and friends of
Cneius Manlius exerted their utmost efforts in his behalf;
and the opinion of the elder senators prevailed, who asserted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1779" id="Page_1779">Pg 1779</a></span>
that there was no instance on record of a commander who had
subdued the enemy, completed the business of his province,
and brought home his army, entering the city as a private
citizen, without honours, and without the chariot and laurel.
This feeling of shame overcame their prejudices against him,
and a great majority voted for his triumph. A greater contest
which was set on foot against a greater and more illustrious
personage, suppressed all mention and memory of this
struggle. The two Petillii, as Valerius Antias writes, instituted
a prosecution against Publius Scipio Africanus. Men
construed this according to their different dispositions; some
did not blame the plebeian tribunes, but the public in general,
that could suffer such a process to be carried on. They observed,
that &#8220;the two greatest states in the world proved,
nearly at the same time, ungrateful to their chief commanders;
but Rome the more ungrateful of the two, because Carthage
was subdued when she sent the vanquished Hannibal into
exile; whereas Rome, when victorious, was for banishing the
conqueror Africanus.&#8221; Others asserted, that &#8220;no one citizen
ought to stand so high above the rest, as not to be made
answerable to the laws for his conduct: for nothing contributed
so much towards the equalization of liberty, as that the
most powerful might be brought to trial. For how could any
charge, especially the administration of government, be safely
intrusted to any man, if he were not liable to be called to an
account? That force was not unjustly used against him who
could not bear an equality of rights.&#8221; These subjects were
discussed in conversation, until the day of trial came. Never
was either any other person, or Scipio himself, when consul
or censor, escorted to the forum by a more numerous multitude
of all kinds, than he was on that day when he appeared to
answer the charge against him. When ordered to make
his defence, without taking any notice of the facts laid to his
charge, he delivered so magnificent a speech concerning his
exploits, that it was universally agreed, that no man had been
ever praised either to more advantage or with more truth.
For his achievements were described with the same ardent
spirit and powerful genius with which they had been performed;
and his auditors felt no disgust, because his acts were
mentioned to meet the peril, and not for ostentation.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b51" name="b51"></a>51</span>
The plebeian tribunes, in order to procure credit to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1780" id="Page_1780">Pg 1780</a></span>
their present accusations, introduced the old imputations of
his luxurious style of living in his winter quarters at Syracuse,
and the tumult raised by Pleminius at Locri. They then
brought forward against him the charge of receiving money,
grounded on suspicion, not on proof. They alleged, that
&#8220;his son, being taken prisoner, was restored without ransom;
and that, in every other instance, Scipio was courted by Antiochus,
as if peace and war with Rome were at his sole disposal.
He had acted towards the consul, in his province, as
dictator, not as lieutenant-general; nor had he gone thither
with any other view than that this might appear to Greece
and Asia, and all the kings and nations eastward, which had
been long since the settled conviction of Spain, Gaul, Sicily,
and Africa, that he alone was the head and pillar of the Roman
empire; that a state which was mistress of the world,
lay sheltered under the shade of Scipio; and that his nods
were equivalent to decrees of the senate, and orders of the
people.&#8221; They attack by envy, as much as they can, him
out of the reach of dishonour. The pleading having lasted
till night, the trial was adjourned to another day. When that
came, the tribunes took their seat in the rostrum at the dawn
of day. The accused being summoned, came, with a numerous
train of friends and dependents, through the middle of
the assembly, to the rostrum; and, silence being made, he
said,&mdash;&#8220;Tribunes of the people, and you, Romans, on the
anniversary of this day I fought a pitched battle in Africa,
with Hannibal and the Carthaginians, with good fortune and
success. As, therefore, it is but decent that a stop be put,
for this day, to litigation and wrangling, I will immediately
go to the Capitol, there to return my acknowledgments to
Jupiter the supremely good and great, to Juno, Minerva, and
the other deities presiding over the Capitol and citadel, and
will give them thanks for having, on this day, and at many
other times, endowed me both with the will and ability to
perform extraordinary services to the commonwealth. Such
of you also, Romans, as it suits, come with me and beseech
the gods that you may have commanders like myself; since,
from my seventeenth year to old age, you have always
anticipated my years with honours, and I, your honours with
services.&#8221; Accordingly, he went up from the rostrum to the
Capitol; and, at the same time, the whole assembly turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1781" id="Page_1781">Pg 1781</a></span>
about and followed him; insomuch, that at last even the clerks
and messengers left the tribunes, not one remaining, except
the slaves who attended them, and the crier, who was in the
habit of summoning the accused from the rostrum. Scipio,
attended by the whole body of the Roman people, went round
all the temples of the gods, not only in the Capitol, but
throughout the whole city. This day was almost more
famous owing to the favour of the Romans towards him, and
their high estimation of his real greatness, than that on
which he rode through Rome in triumph over king Syphax
and the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b52" name="b52"></a>52</span>
It was, however, the last day that shone with lustre on
Publius Scipio. For, as he could foresee nothing but the
prosecutions of envy, and continual disputes with the tribunes,
the trial being adjourned to a future day, he retired to the
territory of Liternum, with a fixed determination not to attend
the trial. His spirit was by nature too lofty, and habituated
to such an elevated course of fortune, that he did not
know how to act the part of an accused person, or stoop to
the humble deportment of men pleading their cause. When
the day came, and he began to be summoned in his absence,
Lucius Scipio pleaded in his excuse that sickness was the
reason of his absence. Which excuse the tribunes, who
were the prosecutors, would not admit, but insisted that he
did not come to plead his cause, owing to the same arrogance
with which he had left the trial, the tribunes of the
people, and the general assembly; and followed by the
very men whom he had robbed of the right of passing
sentence on him, together with their freedom of suffrage,
had exhibited a triumph over the Roman people, and
made a secession, the same day, from the tribunes to the
Capitol. &#8220;You have therefore,&#8221; said they, &#8220;the due reward
of that thoughtless conduct. You are, yourselves, forsaken
by him under whose lead and direction you forsook us. And
so much is our spirit daily on the decline, that although, seventeen
years ago, when he was at the head of an army and
fleet, we had resolution enough to send plebeian tribunes and
an &aelig;dile into Sicily to take him into custody, and bring him
home to Rome; yet we dare not now send to compel him,
though a private citizen, to come from his country-seat to
stand his trial.&#8221; The tribunes of the commons, being appealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1782" id="Page_1782">Pg 1782</a></span>
to by Lucius Scipio, came to the following determination:
that &#8220;since the excuse of sickness was pleaded&#8221; it was their
judgment that this excuse should be admitted, and that the
day of trial should be adjourned by their colleagues.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b53" name="b53"></a>53</span>
Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus was, at that time, a
plebeian tribune, and between him and Publius Scipio there
was an enmity subsisting. When he had forbidden his name
to be subscribed to the determination of his colleague, and
every one expected from him a sentence more severe, he pronounced
his judgment thus: that &#8220;Inasmuch as Lucius Scipio
had pleaded sickness in excuse for his brother, that plea appeared
to him to be sufficient: that he would not suffer Publius
Scipio to be accused until he should return to Rome:
and even then, if he appealed to him, he would support him
in refusing to abide a trial: that Publius Scipio, by his great
achievements, by the honours received from the Roman people,
by the joint consent of gods and men, had risen to such
a height of dignity, that were he to stand as a criminal, under
the rostrum, and afford a hearing to the insults of young men,
it would reflect more disgrace on the Romans than on him.&#8221;
To his decree he added the language of indignation: &#8220;Shall
Scipio, the celebrated conqueror of Africa, stand at the feet
of you, tribunes? Was it for this he defeated and routed,
in Spain, four of the most distinguished generals of the Carthaginians,
and their four armies? Was it for this he took
Syphax prisoner, conquered Hannibal, made Carthage tributary
to you, and removed Antiochus beyond Mount Taurus
(for Lucius Scipio received his brother Africanus as his associate
in this glory); that he should crouch under two Petillii?
that you should gain the palm of victory over Publius Africanus?
Will men of illustrious characters never, through
their own merits, or through honours conferred by you,
arrive at a safe and inviolable sanctuary, where their old age
may repose, if not revered, at least secure from injury?&#8221;
Both his decree and additional discourse made a deep impression,
not only on the rest of the assembly, but even on the
prosecutors; who said that they would consider further what
might be consistent with their rights and duties. Afterwards,
as soon as the assembly of the people broke up, the senate met,
and at that meeting the warmest thanks were bestowed by the
whole body, especially by the consular and elder members, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1783" id="Page_1783">Pg 1783</a></span>
Tiberius Gracchus, for having consulted the public good in
preference to private animosity; and the Petillii were assailed
with severe insults, because they had endeavoured to become
distinguished by exciting odium against another, and were seeking
spoils from a triumph over Africanus. After that there
was silence concerning Africanus. He passed the remainder
of his life at Liternum, without a wish to revisit the city;
and it is said that when he was dying he ordered his body to
be buried in the country, in that very place, and his monument
to be erected there, that even his obsequies might not be
performed in his ungrateful country. He was a man of eminent
merit; but more conspicuous in the affairs of war than in
those of peace. The former part of his life was more illustrious
than the latter, because in his early years wars were
constantly carried on by him; with old age his exploits faded
away, as occasions did not occur to call forth the exercise of
his talents. What was his second consulship to his first, even
if you should add to it the censorship? What, compared with
it, was his commission in Asia, rendered useless by want of
health, and clouded by the misfortune of his son, and the
necessity to which it subjected him after his return, of
either undergoing a trial, or withdrawing himself from that
and his country together. However, he enjoyed alone the
distinguished honour of putting an end to the Carthaginian
war, which was by far the most difficult and dangerous war
in which the Roman state was ever engaged.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b54" name="b54"></a>54</span>
The death of Africanus increased the courage of his
enemies, the chief of whom was Marcus Porcius Cato, who,
even during his life, was accustomed to sneer at his splendid
character. The Petillii are supposed, both to have commenced
the prosecution against Africanus at his instigation while
he was alive, and on his death to have proposed a bill against
him. The motion for the order was made in these words:
&#8220;Romans, is it your will and order, with respect to the money
taken, carried off, and collected from king Antiochus, and
those under his government, and with respect to such part
thereof as has not been accounted for to the public, that
Servius Sulpicius, the city pr&aelig;tor, shall ask the senate which
of the present pr&aelig;tors they will appoint to hold an inquiry
concerning those matters?&#8221; Quintus and Lucius Mummius
at first objected to this motion: they thought it proper that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1784" id="Page_1784">Pg 1784</a></span>
according to the practice always hitherto observed, the senate
should make the inquiry concerning such money as had not been
brought into the public treasury. The Petillii represented the
great influence, the sovereign power which the Scipios possessed
in the senate. Lucius Furius Purpureo, a senator of consular
rank, who had been one of the ten ambassadors in Asia, was of
opinion that the inquiry ought to be carried to a wider extent;
not only as to the money taken from Antiochus, but to what
had been taken from other kings and nations, attacking his
enemy Cneius Manlius. Lucius Scipio, who, it was evident,
was arguing rather in favour of himself than against the
order, stood forward to oppose it. He complained heavily of
such a motion being brought on after the death of his brother,
Publius Africanus, the bravest and most illustrious of men.
For &#8220;it had not been deemed sufficient that Publius Africanus
was not eulogized from the rostrum after his death, unless he
should be also the subject of accusation. The Carthaginians
had been content with the banishment of Hannibal, but the
Roman people would not be satisfied even with the death of
Publius Scipio, unless, after he was laid in his grave, his
character were mangled, and his brother also sacrificed,
another victim to envy.&#8221; Marcus Cato supported the motion
in a speech on the money of king Antiochus, which is still
extant; and, by his influence, deterred the Mummii, the two
tribunes, from their opposition to the order. On their withdrawing
their intended protest, every one of the tribes voted
in favour of the motion.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b55" name="b55"></a>55</span>
Servius Sulpicius then putting the question to the
senate, whom they would appoint, according to the Petillian
order of the people, to hold the inquiry, they appointed
Quintus Terentius Culleo. Before this pr&aelig;tor, so warmly
attached to the Cornelian family, (that those writers, who
say that Publius Scipio died and was buried at Rome, for
that too is asserted, have left on record, that he walked
at his funeral before the bier with a cap of liberty on his
head, as he had done before at his triumph; and that, at the
Capuan gate, he gave wine and honey to those who attended
the obsequies, to show his gratitude for having been recovered
by Scipio, among other captives, out of the hands of the
enemy in Africa,) or so great an enemy to that family, that
on account of his known animosity, he was selected in particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1785" id="Page_1785">Pg 1785</a></span>
by the faction that supported the proceedings against
the Scipios, to hold the inquiry; however that may be, before
this pr&aelig;tor, whether too favourable or too much the contrary,
Lucius Scipio was immediately arraigned. At the same time
charges were presented and received against his lieutenants-general,
the two Hostilius Catos, Aulus and Lucius; and his
qu&aelig;stor, Caius Furius Aculeo: and (that all things might
appear infected with the contagion of peculation) against his
two secretaries and crier, Lucius Hostilius. The secretaries
and the crier were acquitted before Scipio was tried. Scipio
and Aulus Hostilius, his lieutenant-general, and Caius Furius,
were convicted on the following charges, that, &#8220;as bribes, for
granting more favourable terms of peace to Antiochus, Scipio
had received, over and above what he brought into the treasury,
six thousand pounds&#8217; weight of gold, and four hundred
and eighty of silver; Aulus Hostilius, eighty pounds of gold,
and four hundred and three of silver; and Furius, the qu&aelig;stor,
one hundred and thirty of gold, and two hundred of silver.&#8221;
These sums of gold and silver I find mentioned by
Antias. As to what regards Lucius Scipio, I suspect some
mistake of the transcriber, rather than a falsehood of the historian,
respecting the amount of the gold and silver. For it
is more probable that the weight of silver was greater than
that of gold, and that the fine was laid at four millions,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> than
at twenty-four millions of sesterces,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> the more on this account,
as they record that an account of that sum was demanded
from Publius Scipio himself, in the senate; and that when he
had desired his brother Lucius to bring the book of his accounts,
he tore it to pieces in the view of the senate, at the
same time expressing indignation at being called to account
for four millions after he had brought two hundred millions<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
into the treasury. From the same confidence of spirit, when the
qu&aelig;stors would not venture to bring money out of the coffers
contrary to law, he demanded the keys of the treasury, declaring
that he would open it as he had caused it to be shut.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b56" name="b56"></a>56</span>
Many other things are at variance respecting the latter
part, particularly, of Scipio&#8217;s life, that is to say, his trial death,
funeral, and sepulchre, so that I cannot determine which tradition
or which writings I ought to credit. Writers do not agree
as to his accuser; some affirming that Marcus N&aelig;vius, others
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1786" id="Page_1786">Pg 1786</a></span>that the Petillii, instituted the prosecution; neither are they
agreed as to the time when it was carried on; nor the year in
which he died; nor the place; nor where he was buried.
Some assert, that he died and was buried at Rome; others, at
Liternum; and in both places memorials and statues of him
are shown. For at Liternum there was a monument, and on
it stood his statue, which we in person lately saw cast down
by a storm. At Rome likewise, on a monument of the Scipios
outside the Capuan gate, are three statues, two of which are
said to be those of Publius and Lucius Scipio, and the third
that of the poet Quintus Ennius. Nor do these differences
exist between historians only; the speeches attributed to
Publius Scipio and Tiberius Gracchus, if they really are theirs,
differ widely from one another. The title of Publius Scipio&#8217;s
speech bears the name of Marcus N&aelig;vius, the tribune of the
commons; the speech itself does not furnish the name of the prosecutor;
it only calls him sometimes a knave, sometimes a trifler.
Even the speech of Gracchus makes no mention of the Petillii
accusing Africanus, or of the prosecution carried on against him.
An entirely different story must be framed consistent with the
speech of Gracchus; and those writers must be followed who
affirm, that, at the time when Lucius Scipio was impeached,
and convicted of having taken money from the king, Africanus
was a lieutenant-general in Etruria; whence, on hearing of
this misfortune, throwing up his commission, he hastened to
Rome; and when he came straight from the gate to the forum,
because he was told that his brother was being led into confinement,
he drove away the officer from his person; and, on
the tribunes attempting to detain him, laid violent hands on
them, showing more affection towards his brother than regard
for the laws. Of these acts, Gracchus himself complained,
saying, that the tribunitian power was annulled by a private
person; and at last, when he promises support to Lucius
Scipio, he adds, that the precedent would be more tolerable,
if both the tribunitian authority and the state appeared to be
overpowered by a tribune of the commons, than if by a private
citizen. But he loaded him with reproaches for this
signal instance of intemperate violence, in such a manner, that
while he charged him with having degenerated so far from
himself, he gave to him his long-established praises for moderation,
self-control, with many-fold increase, so as to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1787" id="Page_1787">Pg 1787</a></span>
ample amends for the present reprehension. For he said, that
the people were formerly severely rebuked by Scipio, because
they wished to make him perpetual consul and dictator; that
he hindered statues from being erected to him in the comitium,
in the rostrum, in the senate-house, in the Capitol, in the chapel
of Jupiter&#8217;s temple, and that he prevented, a decree being
passed, that his image, in a triumphal habit, should be brought
in procession out of the temple of Jupiter the supremely good
and great. Such particulars as these, which even an enemy acknowledged
while censuring him, even if inserted in a professed
panegyric, would demonstrate an uncommon greatness of
mind, in limiting his honours conformably to his position as a
citizen.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b57" name="b57"></a>57</span>
It is universally agreed, that the younger of Scipio&#8217;s
two daughters was married to this Gracchus; for the elder
was undoubtedly disposed of by her father, to Publius Cornelius
Nasica. But it is not so certain, whether she was both
betrothed and married after her father&#8217;s death, or whether the
accounts are true, that Gracchus, when Lucius Scipio was
being led to prison, and no other of the tribunes interfered to
protect him, swore, that &#8220;the same enmity which he had entertained
against the Scipios still subsisted; and that he did
not perform any act for the sake of gaining their favour.
But that, having seen Publius Africanus leading the kings
and generals of enemies to prison, he would never suffer his
brother to be led to the same place.&#8221; They add, that the
senators, happening to sup that day in the Capitol, rose up
together, and requested of Africanus, before the company
departed, to betroth his daughter to Gracchus: that the contract
was accordingly executed in due form, in the presence
of this assembly; and that Scipio, on his return home, told
his wife &AElig;milia that he had concluded a match for her younger
daughter. That she, feeling her female pride hurt, expressing
some resentment on not having been consulted in the disposal
of their common child, added, that, even were he giving her
to Tiberius Gracchus, her mother ought not to be kept in ignorance
of his intention; to which Scipio, rejoiced at her
judgment concurring so entirely with his own, replied, that
she was betrothed to that very man. These circumstances
respecting so great a captain, though they might vary, both
in traditionary and written relation, ought to be stated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1788" id="Page_1788">Pg 1788</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b58" name="b58"></a>58</span>
On the proceedings being finished by the pr&aelig;tor Quintius
Terentius, Hostilius and Furius, being condemned, gave
securities the same day to the city qu&aelig;stors. Scipio, when
he insisted that all the money received by him was in the
treasury, and that he had not in his possession any thing
whatever belonging to the public, was ordered to prison.
Publius Scipio Nasica then appealed to the tribunes, and made
a speech fraught with just encomiums, not only on the Cornelian
family in general, but on his own branch of it in particular.
&#8220;His father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the father of Publius
Africanus and Lucius Scipio, who was now ordered to prison,
were Cneius and Publius Scipio, men of the most illustrious
characters; that when, through a long course of years, they
had highly enhanced the reputation of the Roman name in
the land of Spain, against many commanders and many
armies of the Carthaginians and Spaniards, not only by their
military exploits, but also by exhibiting to the nations of that
country brilliant examples of Roman moderation and fidelity,
both, at last, fell in the service of the Roman people. Although
it ought to be sufficient to their descendants to support
the glory derived from them, yet Publius Africanus so far surpassed
his father&#8217;s renown, as to occasion a belief that he was
not sprung from the human race, but was of divine extraction.
As to Lucius Scipio, concerning whom the question then was,
to pass over his exploits in Spain and in Africa, (while he was
lieutenant-general to his brother,) on his being elected consul,
was by the senate considered so worthy, that the province
of Asia and the war with Antiochus were assigned him,
without leaving it to the decision of the lots; and by his
brother, that, after two consulships, the censorship, and a triumph,
he attended him into Asia in quality of lieutenant-general.
There, that the great and splendid character of the
lieutenant might not eclipse the fame of the consul, it so happened,
that, on the day when Lucius Scipio conquered Antiochus
in a pitched battle at Magnesia, Publius Scipio was
absent at the distance of several days&#8217; journey, being sick at
El&aelig;a. The army of the enemy, on that occasion, was not inferior
to that of Hannibal, when the battle was fought with
him in Africa; and the same Hannibal, who was commander-in-chief
in the Carthaginian war, was among many other
generals of the king. The war indeed was so conducted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1789" id="Page_1789">Pg 1789</a></span>
that no one could throw blame even on fortune. A ground
of accusation is sought for in the peace; it is said that it was
sold. The ten ambassadors, in pursuance of whose counsel
the peace was concluded, are at the same time included in this
charge. Some of the ten ambassadors had even stood forth
as accusers of Cneius Manlius, yet their charges were so far
from gaining credit that they did not produce even a delay of
his triumph.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b59" name="b59"></a>59</span>
&#8220;But truly, in the case of Scipio, the articles of the
peace are suspected as being too favourable to Antiochus.
For his entire kingdom has been left to him: although conquered,
he retains possession of every thing that belonged to
him before the war; and though, he had an immense quantity
of gold and silver, none of it has been applied to the use of
the public: all has been converted to private purposes. Now,
was there not a quantity of gold and silver carried before the
eyes of the public in the triumph of Lucius Scipio, so great
that an equal quantity was not carried in ten of the former
triumphs, even if it was amassed together? Why need I
speak of the extent of the kingdom of Antiochus, or that he
held all Asia, and the adjoining parts of Europe? Every
body knows what a large portion of the surface of the earth
that is, which stretches from Mount Taurus quite to the
&AElig;gean Sea; what a number, not only of cities, but of nations,
it comprehends; and that this tract, as far as the summit of
Mount Taurus, more than thirty days&#8217; journey in length and
ten in breadth, from one sea to the other,&mdash;has been taken
from Antiochus, who is thereby removed to the most distant
corner of the world? Now if peace had been granted
him without any pecuniary consideration, could more have
been taken from him? Macedon was left to Philip after he
was conquered; Laced&aelig;mon to Nabis; yet the grounds of
an accusation were never sought against Quinctius on that
account. The reason was, that he had not Africanus for a
brother, whose high renown ought to have been serviceable
to Lucius Scipio; but envy of his merit had done him injury.
A quantity of gold and silver was mentioned in the senate to
have been conveyed to the house of Lucius Scipio, greater
than could be raised from the sale of his whole property.
Where, then, was all this royal treasure; where the value of
so many estates received? Surely in a house, which extravagance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1790" id="Page_1790">Pg 1790</a></span>
never exhausted, this new accumulation of wealth
ought to appear. But what cannot be levied out of his
effects, the enemies of Lucius Scipio will exact from his
person, and from his very flesh, by vexatious persecution and
insult; carried to such a degree that a man of his illustrious
character would be shut up in a prison, among midnight
thieves and robbers, and forced to breathe his last in a
dungeon and in darkness, and his naked corpse thrown before
the prison door. Such proceedings will reflect more disgrace
on the city of Rome, than they will on the Cornelian family.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="b60" name="b60"></a>60</span>
In answer to this, the pr&aelig;tor, Terentius, read the
Petillian order of the people, the decree of the senate, and
the judgment pronounced against Lucius Scipio; and declared
that unless the money adjudged were paid into the public
treasury, he had no other step to take, than to order the person
convicted to be taken into custody, and carried to prison.
The tribunes retired to confer together, and in a short time
after, Caius Fannius, according to his own opinion and that
of all his colleagues, except Gracchus, declared that the tribunes
would not interfere with the pr&aelig;tor to hinder his
making use of his power. Tiberius Gracchus thus decreed:
&#8220;that he would not protest against the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s levying the
sum adjudged out of the effects of Lucius Scipio; but that
Lucius Scipio, who had subdued the most powerful king in
the world, had extended the empire of the Roman people to
the utmost limits of the earth, had bound under obligations to
the Roman people king Eumenes, the Rhodians, and so many
other states of Asia, and had led in triumph so many generals
of the enemies, and imprisoned them, should himself lie in
prison among the enemies of the Roman people, and in chains,
he never would suffer; and therefore he ordered him to be
discharged.&#8221; This decision was heard with such approbation,
and the people beheld with so much pleasure the liberation
of Scipio, that it could hardly appear that the sentence had
been passed in the same community. The pr&aelig;tor then sent
the qu&aelig;stors to take possession of Lucius Scipio&#8217;s property,
for the use of the public. And not only did no trace appear
of money received from the king, but not even so much was
made up from the sale as the sum in which he was fined. So
large a contribution was made for Lucius Scipio by his
relations, friends, and clients, that, if he had accepted it, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1791" id="Page_1791">Pg 1791</a></span>
would have been much richer than before this misfortune: but
he received nothing. Such things as were necessary for his
family occasions, were bought back at the sale by his nearest
relations. And the public hatred which had been pointed
against the Scipios, reverted on the pr&aelig;tor, his advisers, and
the accusers.</p>

<h2><a name="bk39" id="bk39"></a>BOOK XXXIX.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Marcus &AElig;milius, the consul, having subdued the Ligurians, made a road
from Placentia as far as Ariminum, and connected it with the Flaminian
way. The commencement of luxury, introduced by the Asiatic army,
is related. All the Ligurians who dwell on the hither side of the
Apennines were subdued. The Bacchanalia, a Grecian sacred ceremony,
held at night, a hot-bed of every vice, after having become a
conspiracy including great numbers, were discovered by one of the consuls
and suppressed, while many of those concerned were punished.
Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, the brother of Titus, was expelled the
senate, by the censors Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius
Cato, who was most distinguished in the arts of war and peace, for the
following reason: because when, as consul, he had held the province of
Gaul, he slew with his own hand a certain Gaul, at the request of
Philip, a Carthaginian, his noble minion; or, as some have stated,
because he had beheaded a condemned criminal at the request of a
courtesan of Placentia, with whom he was desperately in love. The
speech of Marcus Cato against him is still extant. Scipio died at Liternum.
And, as if fortune destined for the same period the death of the
two most distinguished men of the day, Hannibal committed suicide by
taking poison, when he was on the point of being given up to the
Romans by Prusias, king of Bithynia, to whom he had fled for refuge
on the defeat of Antiochus: the Romans had sent Titus Quinctius
Flamininus to demand Hannibal. Philop&#339;men likewise, the general of
the Ach&aelig;ans, a most distinguished man, after having fallen into the
hands of the Messenians in war, was put to death by poison. Colonies
are planted at Potentia, Pisaurus, Modena, and Parma. This book
contains in addition the success over the Celtiberians, and the commencement
and cause of the Macedonian war; the origin of which proceeded
from the following source: Philip was dissatisfied that his kingdom was
being diminished by the Romans, and because he was compelled to withdraw
his garrisons from Thrace and other places.</i></p>

While these things are done at Rome, (if they were
truly transacted in this year,) both the consuls were employed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1792" id="Page_1792">Pg 1792</a></span>
in the war with the Ligurians. This enemy seemed
born for the purpose of preserving military discipline among
the Romans, during the intervals between important wars;
nor was any province better calculated to form a soldier to
active valour. For Asia, from the enticing pleasures of its
cities, the abundance of every production both of land and
sea, the unwarlike temper of the enemy, and the wealth of
its princes, made Roman armies rich, rather than brave.
Under the command of Cneius Manlius, particularly, the
troops were kept in a state of idleness and licentiousness.
Therefore, in Thrace, a passage somewhat more difficult, and
a more vigorous enemy, checked them with severe loss.
Whereas in Liguria there was every circumstance that could
invigorate the courage of soldiers; the country mountainous
and rugged, so that even the taking possession of unoccupied
posts, and much more the dislodging of an enemy from those
already in possession, was attended with much labour; the
roads hilly, narrow, and exposed to ambuscades; the enemy
light, active, and energetic in their motions, so as to allow no
season or place to be quiet or secure; the necessary attack on
the strong forts with much toil and danger; and the country
so poor as to constrain the soldier to a sparing mode of living,
while it afforded but a small share of booty. Accordingly,
no sutler followed the army, no long train of baggage horses
extended its line of march, nothing was to be seen but arms, and
men having all their hopes in their arms. Nor was either subject
or cause for hostilities with them ever wanting; because
on account of their poverty at home they made frequent incursions
on the territories of their neighbours; they did not.
however, fight a battle which could decide the entire war.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c2" name="c2"></a>2</span>
The consul, Caius Flaminius, after several successful
battles against the Frinian Ligurians in their own country,
received the submission of that tribe, and ordered them
to deliver up their arms; as they did not give them up
honourably, and were reproved for their behaviour, who
abandoned their villages, and fled to the mountain called
Auginus, whither the consul immediately followed them. A
part of the enemy again betook themselves to flight; and,
running with precipitate haste, the greatest part without
arms, over pathless tracts and rocky precipices, they escaped
to places where an enemy could not follow them. Thus they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1793" id="Page_1793">Pg 1793</a></span>
got away beyond the Apennine; the rest, who remained in
the camp, were surrounded and reduced by assault. The
legions were then led over the Apennine; then the enemy,
assisted by the height of the mountain, which they had occupied
at first, stood on their defence; but, in a little time,
submitted. Their arms were then sought for with greater
care and all taken from them. The war was then transferred
to the Apuan tribe of Ligurians, who had made so many incursions
into the territory of Pisa and Bononia, that it could
not be cultivated. These being entirely subdued, the consul
restored peace to the neighbourhood. And, as he had
effected the security of the province from the war, he made
a road from Bononia to Anetium, that he might not keep
the soldiers in a state of idleness. The other consul, Marcus
&AElig;milius, ravaged with fire and sword the lands of the Ligurians,
together with their villages that stood in the plains,
while the inhabitants remained posted on two mountains,
Ballista and Suismontium. He then attacked those who were
on the mountains, harassed them for some time in skirmishes,
and, at last, compelled them to come to an engagement, and
utterly defeated them in a regular battle: in which he
vowed a temple to Diana. Having now reduced all on this
side of the Apennine, he marched against those on the other
side of that mountain; among whom were the Brinian tribe,
which had not been attacked by Flaminius: &AElig;milius subdued
them all, stripped them of their arms, and obliged the multitude
to come down from the mountains into the plains. The
Ligurians being brought to a state of peace, he led his army
into the Gallic territory, and drew a road from Placentia to
Ariminum, to meet that made by Flaminius. During the
last engagement, when he fought a pitched battle with the
Ligurians, he vowed a temple to Imperial Juno. Such were
the transactions of this year in Liguria.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c3" name="c3"></a>3</span>
In Gaul, the pr&aelig;tor, Marcus Furius, seeking a pretext
for war in the midst of peace, deprived, the unoffending
C&aelig;nomanians of their arms. The C&aelig;nomanians complained
of this to the senate at Rome, and were by them referred to
the consul &AElig;milius, whom the senate authorized to examine
into and determine the cause; after a warm contest with the
pr&aelig;tor they gained their cause. The pr&aelig;tor was ordered to restore
their arms to the C&aelig;nomanians, and quit the province.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1794" id="Page_1794">Pg 1794</a></span></p>

<p>The senate afterwards gave audience to envoys of the Latin
confederation, who had come, in great numbers, from all parts
of Latium. On their complaint that a great multitude of
their citizens had been removed to Rome, and had been
assessed there in the survey; a commission was given to
Quintus Terentius Culleo, the pr&aelig;tor, to make inquiry
after such persons; and on the allies proving that those
persons themselves, or their fathers, had been assessed in
the surveys of their states in the censorship of Caius Claudius
and Marcus Livius, or at some time subsequent to
their censorship, he was ordered to compel all such to return
to the several states wherein they had been so rated.
In consequence of this inquiry, twelve thousand Latins returned
home; as the multitude of foreigners even then burdened
the city.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c4" name="c4"></a>4</span>
Before the consuls came home to Rome, Marcus Fulvius,
the proconsul, returned from &AElig;tolia. He, when he had as usual
recited to the senate, in the temple of Apollo, the services
which he had performed in &AElig;tolia and Cephallenia, then requested
of the fathers, that, in consideration of his having
conducted the business of the public with good fortune and
success, they would think proper to order public thanks to be
offered to the immortal gods, and to decree a triumph to him.
Marcus Abutius, a tribune of the commons, gave notice, that, if
any thing were determined on that subject before the arrival of
Marcus &AElig;milius, he would enter his protest: for &#8220;the consul
intended to oppose that measure; and, at his setting out for
his province, had given him a charge to keep the discussion
of it open until he should come home. That Fulvius would
suffer a loss of nothing but time; for, notwithstanding the
presence of the consul, the senate would determine according
to their own wishes.&#8221; Fulvius replied, that, &#8220;even if the
quarrel subsisting between him and Marcus &AElig;milius was unknown
to the world, or with what overbearing, and, in some
measure, tyrannical rancour, that man prosecuted his enmity;
yet it was insufferable, that the absence of the consul should
both obstruct the worship of the immortal gods, and delay a
triumph merited and due; that a commander, after performing
signal services, and his victorious army with its booty and
prisoners, should remain outside the gates, until a consul, who
purposely delayed abroad, should be pleased to return to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1795" id="Page_1795">Pg 1795</a></span>
Rome. But, in the present case, when the animosity between
him and the consul was most notorious, what fair dealing
could any one expect from a man who procured clandestinely,
in a thin house, and lodged in the treasury, a decree of the
senate, that &#8220;it did not appear that Ambracia was taken by
force:&#8221; a town which was attacked with mounds and engines;
where, after the works were burned, others were constructed
anew; where a fight was carried on around the walls for
fifteen days, both above and under ground; where, from the
first dawn, when the soldiers mounted the walls, a battle, for
a long time doubtful, lasted until night; and where more than
three thousand of the enemy were killed? Then, again, what
a malicious misrepresentation did he make to the pontiffs, of
the temples of the immortal gods being plundered in a
captured city! If it were allowable that Rome should be
decorated with the ornaments of Syracuse, and other conquered
places, then the laws of war must lose their force in
the case of Ambracia alone, among conquered towns. For
his part, he besought the conscript fathers, and requested the
tribunes, not to suffer him to become a subject of derision to
a most haughty enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c5" name="c5"></a>5</span>
All around were in his favour; and some entreated the
tribune to desist, while others sharply reproved his conduct.
The speech of his colleague, Tiberius Gracchus, moved him
most, that, &#8220;for a man in office to prosecute even his own
quarrels, was an example of no good tendency; but, that a
tribune of the people should take upon himself to be a solicitor
in the quarrel of another, was infamous, and highly unworthy
of the power and sacred laws of the order to which he belonged.
That men ought to love or hate others, approve or
disapprove of measures, according to the dictates of their own
judgment; but that a tribune ought not to depend on the look
or nod of another man, veer about at the movements of
another&#8217;s will, and make himself a tool to his displeasure; nor
remember a private charge, committed to him by Marcus
&AElig;milius, and forget that the tribuneship was a public charge,
intrusted to him by the Roman people, for the protection
and liberty of private citizens, not to aggrandize the arbitrary
power of a consul. His colleague did not seem to consider that
this circumstance would be committed to record and posterity:
that, of two plebeian tribunes of the same college, one sacrificed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1796" id="Page_1796">Pg 1796</a></span>
his own resentment to the public good, the other prosecuted
the resentment of another man which was merely intrusted
to him.&#8221; When the tribune, overcome by these severe rebukes,
had withdrawn from the meeting, a triumph was voted
to Marcus Fulvius, on the motion of Servius Sulpicius, the
pr&aelig;tor. When he returned thanks to the conscript fathers,
he then mentioned, that, &#8220;on the day of his taking Ambracia,
he had vowed to celebrate the great games in honour of
Jupiter the supremely good and great; that a contribution for
that purpose had been made to him by the several states,
amounting to one hundred and ten pounds&#8217; weight of gold;
and he requested them to order that sum to be set apart, out
of the money which he was to deposit in the treasury, after
being borne in triumph.&#8221; The senate ordered the college of
pontiffs to be consulted, whether it were necessary that the
whole of that sum should be expended on the games: when
the pontiffs had answered, that it mattered little to religion
what was the expense of the games, the senate gave permission
to Fulvius to expend as much as he thought proper, provided
he did not exceed eighty thousand sesterces.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> He, at
first, intended to celebrate his triumph in the month of January;
but, hearing that the consul &AElig;milius, in consequence
of a letter from the tribune Abutius, concerning his waving
his protest, was coming in person to Rome, to hinder his
triumph, but had been obliged, by sickness to halt on the road,
he hastened the time of the celebration, lest he should have
more contests about it than he had met in the war. He triumphed
over the &AElig;tolians and Cephallenia on the tenth day
before the calends of January. There were carried before his
chariot, golden crowns to the amount of one hundred and
twelve pounds&#8217; weight; of silver, eighty-three thousand
pounds; of gold, two hundred and forty-three thousand; of
Attic tetradrachms, one hundred and eighteen thousand;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
of the coin called Philippeans, twelve thousand four hundred
and twenty-two;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> brazen statues, two hundred and eighty-five;
marble statues, two hundred and thirty; arms, weapons,
and other spoils in great quantities: besides these, catapultas,
ballistas, and engines of every kind; and in the procession
were led twenty-seven commanders, either &AElig;tolian and Cephallenian,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1797" id="Page_1797">Pg 1797</a></span>
or belonging to king Antiochus, and left with
them. Before he rode into the city, in the Flaminian circus,
he presented great numbers of tribunes, pr&aelig;fects, horsemen,
centurions, both Romans and allies, with military gifts; to
each of the soldiers he distributed out of the booty twenty-five
denariuses,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> double to a centurion, triple to a horseman.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c6" name="c6"></a>6</span>
The time of the election of consuls now approached;
and as Marcus &AElig;milius, to whose lot that business had fallen,
could not attend, Caius Flaminius came home to Rome.
Spurius Posthumius Albinus and Quintus Marcus Philippus
were elected consuls by him. Then were chosen as pr&aelig;tors,&mdash;Titus
M&aelig;nius, Publius Cornelius Sulla, Caius Calpurnius Piso,
Marcus Licinius Lucullus, Caius Aurelius Scaurus, and Lucius
Quintius Crispinus. At the close of the year, after the
magistrates were appointed, on the third day before the nones
of March, Cneius Manlius Vulso triumphed over the Gauls
inhabiting Asia. The reason of his deferring his triumph so
long was, to avoid standing a trial under the Petillian law,
during the pr&aelig;torship of Quintus Terentius Culleo; and the
being involved in the ill consequences of the sentence passed
on another, that by which Lucius Scipio was condemned;
especially as the judges would be more disposed to severity
against him than against Scipio, for this reason, because fame
had reported, that he, Scipio&#8217;s successor, had, by tolerating
every description of licentiousness, ruined military discipline,
so strictly preserved by his predecessor. Nor were the facts,
which were reported to have happened in the province far
from the eyes of spectators, the only things that disgraced
his character; but still more so, those circumstances which
were every day beheld in his soldiers; for by this army returning
from Asia was the origin of foreign luxury imported
into the city. These men first brought to Rome gilded couches,
rich tapestry, with hangings and other works of the loom;
and, what were then deemed magnificent furniture, single-footed
tables and buffets. At entertainments, likewise, were
introduced female players on the harp and timbrel, with buffoons
for the diversion of the guests. Their meats also began
to be prepared with greater care and cost; while the cook,
whom the ancients considered as the meanest of their slaves
both in estimation and use, became highly valuable, and what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1798" id="Page_1798">Pg 1798</a></span>was considered as a servile office began to be considered an
art. Nevertheless, those introductions which were then
looked on as remarkable were scarcely even the seeds of the
future luxury.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c7" name="c7"></a>7</span>
Cneius Manlius carried in the triumph two hundred
golden crowns of twelve pounds&#8217; weight; two hundred and
twenty thousand pounds&#8217; weight of silver; two thousand two
hundred and three of gold; one hundred and twenty-seven thousand
Attic tetradrachms;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> two hundred and fifty thousand cistophoruses;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
sixteen thousand three hundred and twenty golden
Philippeans;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> together with abundance of Gallic arms and
spoils in chariots. Fifty-two generals of the enemy were led
before his car. He distributed to each of his soldiers forty-two
denariuses,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and double that sum to a centurion; to the foot-soldiers
double pay, to the horsemen triple. Great numbers of all
ranks, whom he had distinguished by gifts, accompanied him.
The verses thrown out by the soldiers were of such a kind,
that it was quite evident that they were sung to a commander
who had been indulgent to them, and courted their affections.
It was indeed evident that the triumph was celebrated with a
greater degree of favour by the troops, than by the citizens.
The friends of Manlius, however, were able to acquire for him
the regard of the people also; through whose efforts a decree
of the senate was passed, ordering, that &#8220;such part of the
soldiers&#8217; pay, contributed to the public funds by the people, as
was not yet repaid, should be discharged out of that which had
been carried in the procession to the treasury.&#8221; Accordingly
the city pr&aelig;tors, with care and fidelity, paid twenty-five denariuses
and a half<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> instead of each thousand asses.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> About this
time two military tribunes arrived from the two Spains with
letters from Caius Atinius and Lucius Manlius, who governed
those provinces. From these letters it appeared, that the
Celtiberians and Lusitanians were in arms, and ravaging the
territories of the allies; the senate, however, deferred all consideration
of that business until the new magistrates should
come into office. This year, during the celebration of the
Roman games which Publius Cornelius Cethegus and Aulus
Postumius Albinus exhibited, a pole in the circus, being
loosely set in the ground, fell on the statue of Pollentia, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1799" id="Page_1799">Pg 1799</a></span>
threw it down. The senate moved by such a religious circumstance,
voted that one day should be added to the celebration
of the games, that two statues should be set up instead of the
one, and that one of them, a new statue, should be gilded.
The plebeian games were likewise repeated for one day, by the
&aelig;diles Caius Sempronius Bl&aelig;sus and Marcus Furius Luscus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c8" name="c8"></a>8</span>
The following year diverted Spurius Postumius Albinus
and Quintus Marcius Philippus, from the care of armies,
and wars, and provinces, to the punishing of an intestine conpiracy.
The pr&aelig;tors cast lots for their provinces, Titus
M&aelig;nius obtained the city jurisdiction; Marcus Licinius Lucullus,
that between citizens and foreigners; Caius Aurelius
Scaurus, Sardinia; Publius Cornelius Sulla, Sicily; Lucius
Quintius Crispinus, Hither Spain; Caius Calpurnius Piso,
Farther Spain. The making inquisition concerning clandestine
meetings was decreed to both the consuls. A Greek of
mean condition came, first, into Etruria, not with one of the
many trades which his nation, of all others the most skilful in
the cultivation of the mind and body, has introduced among us,
but a low operator in sacrifices, and a soothsayer; nor was he
one who, by open religious rites, and by publicly professing his
calling and teaching, imbued the minds of his followers with
terror, but a priest of secret and nocturnal rites. These
mysterious rites were, at first, imparted to a few, but afterwards
communicated to great numbers, both men and women.
To their religious performances were added the pleasures of
wine and feasting, to allure a greater number of proselytes.
When wine, lascivious discourse, night, and the intercourse of
the sexes had extinguished every sentiment of modesty, then
debaucheries of every kind began to be practised, as every
person found at hand that sort of enjoyment to which he was
disposed by the passion predominant in his nature. Nor
were they confined to one species of vice&mdash;the promiscuous
intercourse of free-born men and women; but from this
store-house of villany proceeded false witnesses, counterfeit
seals, false evidences, and pretended discoveries. From
the same place, too, proceeded poison and secret murders, so
that in some cases, even the bodies could not be found for
burial. Many of their audacious deeds were brought about by
treachery, but most of them by force; it served to conceal the
violence, that, on account of the loud shouting, and the noise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1800" id="Page_1800">Pg 1800</a></span>
of drums and cymbals, none of the cries uttered by the persons
suffering violation or murder could be heard abroad.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c9" name="c9"></a>9</span>
The infection of this mischief, like that from the contagion
of disease, spread from Etruria to Rome; where, the
size of the city affording greater room for such evils, and more
means of concealment, cloaked it at first; but information
of it was at length brought to the consul, Postumius, principally
in the following manner. Publius &AElig;butius, whose
father had held equestrian rank in the army, was left an orphan,
and his guardians dying, he was educated under the
eye of his mother Duronia, and his stepfather Titus Sempronius
Rutilus. Duronia was entirely devoted to her husband;
and Sempronius, having managed the guardianship in such a
manner that he could not give an account of the property, wished
that his ward should be either made away with, or bound
to compliance with his will by some strong tie. The Bacchanalian
rites were the only way to effect the ruin of the youth. His
mother told him, that, &#8220;during his sickness, she had made a
vow for him, that if he should recover, she would initiate him
among the Bacchanalians; that being, through the kindness of
the gods, bound by this vow, she wished now to fulfil it; that
it was necessary he should preserve chastity for ten days, and
on the tenth, after he should have supped and washed himself,
she would conduct him into the place of worship.&#8221; There
was a freedwoman called Hispala Fecenia, a noted courtesan,
but deserving of a better lot than the mode of life to which
she had been accustomed when very young, and a slave, and
by which she had maintained herself since her manumission.
As they lived in the same neighbourhood, an intimacy subsisted
between her and &AElig;butius, which was far from being
injurious either to the young man&#8217;s character or property;
for he had been loved and wooed by her unsolicited; and
as his friends supplied his wants illiberally, he was supported
by the generosity of this woman; nay, to such a length did
she go under the influence of her affection, that, on the death
of her patron, because she was under the protection of no
one, having petitioned the tribunes and pr&aelig;tors for a guardian,
when she was making her will, she constituted &AElig;butius her
sole heir.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c10" name="c10"></a>10</span>
As such pledges of mutual love subsisted, and as neither
kept any thing secret from the other, the young man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1801" id="Page_1801">Pg 1801</a></span>
jokingly bid her not be surprised if he separated himself from
her for a few nights; as, &#8220;on account of a religious duty, to
a vow made for his health, he intended to be initiated
among the Bacchanalians.&#8221; On hearing this, the woman,
greatly alarmed, cried out, &#8220;May the gods will more favourably!&#8221;
affirming that &#8220;it would be better, both for him and
her, to lose their lives than that he should do such a thing:&#8221;
she then imprecated curses, vengeance, and destruction, on the
head of those who advised him to such a step. The young
man, surprised both at her expressions and at the violence of
her alarm, bid her refrain from curses, for &#8220;it was his mother
who ordered him to do so, with the approbation of his stepfather.&#8221;
&#8220;Then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;your stepfather (for perhaps it is
not allowable to censure your mother) is in haste to destroy, by
that act, your chastity, your character, your hopes, and your life.&#8221;
To him, now surprised by such language, and inquiring what
was the matter, she said, (after imploring the favour and pardon
of the gods and goddesses, if, compelled by her regard for
him, she disclosed what ought not to be revealed,) that &#8220;when
in service, she had gone into that place of worship, as an attendant
on her mistress; but that, since she had obtained her
liberty, she had never once gone near it: that she knew it to
be the receptacle of all kinds of debaucheries; that it was
well known that, for two years past, no one older than twenty
had been initiated there. When any person was introduced
he was delivered as a victim to the priests, who led him away
to a place resounding with shouts, the sound of music, and
the beating of cymbals and drums, lest his cries, while suffering
violation, should be heard abroad.&#8221; She then entreated
and besought him to put an end to that matter in some way or
other; and not to plunge himself into a situation, where he
must first, suffer, and afterwards commit, every thing that was
abominable. Nor did she quit him until the young man gave
her his promise to keep himself clear of those rites.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c11" name="c11"></a>11</span>
When he came home, and his mother made mention of
such things pertaining to the ceremony as were to be performed
on this day, and on the several following days, he told
her that he would not perform any of them, nor did he intend
to be initiated. His stepfather was present at this discourse.
Immediately the woman observed, that &#8220;he could not deprive
himself of the company of Hispala for ten nights; that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1802" id="Page_1802">Pg 1802</a></span>
was so fascinated by the caresses and baneful influence of that
serpent, that he retained no respect for his mother or stepfather,
or even the gods themselves.&#8221; His mother on one
side and his stepfather on the other loading him with reproaches,
drove him out of the house, assisted by four slaves.
The youth on this repaired to his aunt &AElig;butia, told her the
reason of his being turned out by his mother, and the next
day, by her advice, gave information of the affair to the consul
Postumius, without any witnesses of the interview. The
consul dismissed him, with an order to come again on the
third day following. In the mean time, he inquired of his
mother-in-law Sulpicia, a woman of respectable character,
&#8220;whether she knew an old matron called &AElig;butia, who lived
on the Aventine hill?&#8221; When she had answered that &#8220;she
knew her well, and that &AElig;butia was a woman of virtue, and
of the ancient purity of morals&#8221;; he said that he required a
conference with her, and that a messenger should be sent for
her to come. &AElig;butia, on receiving the message, came to Sulpicia&#8217;s
house, and the consul, soon after, coming in, as if by
accident, introduced a conversation about &AElig;butius, her brother&#8217;s
son. The tears of the woman burst forth, and she began
to lament the unhappy lot of the youth: &#8220;who, after being
robbed of his property by persons whom it least of all became,
was then residing with her, being driven out of doors by his
mother, because, being a good youth, (may the gods be propitious
to him,)&#8221; he refused to be initiated in ceremonies devoted
to lewdness, as report goes.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c12" name="c12"></a>12</span>
The consul, thinking that he had made sufficient inquiries
concerning &AElig;butius, and that his testimony was unquestionable,
having dismissed &AElig;butia, requested his mother-in-law
to send again to the Aventine, and bring from that
quarter Hispala, a freedwoman, not unknown in that neighbourhood;
for there were some queries which he wished to
make of her. Hispala being alarmed because she was sent
for by a woman of such high rank and respectable character,
and being ignorant of the cause, after that she saw the lictors
in the porch, the multitude attending on the consul and the
consul himself, was very near fainting. The consul led her
into a retired part of the house, and, in the presence of his
mother-in-law, told her, that &#8220;she need not be uneasy, if she
could resolve to speak the truth. She might receive a promise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1803" id="Page_1803">Pg 1803</a></span>
of protection either from Sulpicia, a matron of such dignified
character, or from himself. That she ought to tell him,
what was accustomed to be done at the Bacchanalia, in the nocturnal
orgies in the grove of Stimula. When the woman heard
this, such terror and trembling of all her limbs seized her, that
for a long time she was unable to speak; but recovering, at length
she said, that &#8220;when she was very young, and a slave, she had
been initiated, together with her mistress; but for several years
past, since she had obtained her liberty, she knew nothing of
what was done there.&#8221; The consul commended her so far, as
not having denied that she was initiated, but charged her to
explain all the rest with the same sincerity; and told her, affirming
that she knew nothing further, that &#8220;there would
not be the same tenderness or pardon extended to her, if she
should be convicted by another person, and one who had
made a voluntary confession; that there was such a person,
who had heard the whole from her, and had given him a full
account of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c13" name="c13"></a>13</span>
The woman, now thinking without a doubt
that it must certainly be &AElig;butius who had discovered the
secret, threw herself at Sulpicia&#8217;s feet, and at first began to
beseech her, &#8220;not to let the private conversation of a freedwoman
with her lover be turned not only into a serious business,
but even capital charge;&#8221; declaring that &#8220;she had
spoken of such things merely to frighten him, and not because
she knew any thing of the kind.&#8221; On this Postumius, growing
angry, said, &#8220;she seemed to imagine that then too she
was wrangling with her gallant &AElig;butius, and not that she
was speaking in the house of a most respectable matron, and
to a consul.&#8221; Sulpicia raised her, terrified, from the ground,
and while she encouraged her to speak out, at the same time
pacified her son-in-law&#8217;s anger. At length she took courage,
and, having censured severely the perfidy of &AElig;butius, because
he had made such a return for the extraordinary kindness
shown to him in that very instance, she declared that &#8220;she
stood in great dread of the gods, whose secret mysteries she
was to divulge; and in much greater dread of the men implicated,
who would tear her asunder with their hands if she
became an informer. Therefore, she entreated this favour of
Sulpicia, and likewise of the consul, that they would send her
away to some place out of Italy, where she might pass the
remainder of her life in safety.&#8221; The consul desired her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1804" id="Page_1804">Pg 1804</a></span>
be of good spirits, and said that it should be his care that she
might live securely in Rome.</p>

<p>Hispala then gave a full account of the origin of the
mysteries. &#8220;At first,&#8221; she said, &#8220;those rites were performed
by women. No man used to be admitted. They had three
stated days in the year on which persons were initiated among
the Bacchanalians, in the day-time. The matrons used to be
appointed priestesses, in rotation. Paculla Minia, a Campanian,
when priestesss, made an alteration in every particular,
as if by the direction of the gods. For she first
introduced men, who were her own sons, Minucius and
Herrenius, both surnamed Cerrinius; changed the time of
celebration, from day to night; and, instead of three days in
the year, appointed five days of initiation, in each month.
From the time that the rites were thus made common, and
men were intermixed with women, and the licentious freedom
of the night was added, there was nothing wicked, nothing
flagitious, that had not been practised among them. There
were more frequent pollution of men, with each other, than
with women. If any were less patient in submitting to dishonour,
or more averse to the commission of vice, they were
sacrificed as victims. To think nothing unlawful, was the
grand maxim of their religion. The men, as if bereft of reason,
uttered predictions, with frantic contortions of their
bodies; the women, in the habit of Bacchantes, with their
hair dishevelled, and carrying blazing torches, ran down to
the Tiber; where, dipping their torches in the water, they
drew them up again with the flame unextinguished, being
composed of native sulphur and charcoal. They said that
those men were carried off by the gods, whom the machines
laid hold of and dragged from their view into secret caves.
These were such as refused to take the oath of the society, or
to associate in their crimes, or to submit to defilement. Their
number was exceedingly great now, almost a second state in
themselves, and among them were many men and women of
noble families. During the last two years it had been a rule,
that no person above the age of twenty should be initiated;
for they sought for people of such age as made them more
liable to suffer deception and personal abuse.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c14" name="c14"></a>14</span>
When she had completed her information, she again fell at the consuls
knees, and repeated the same entreaties, that he might send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1805" id="Page_1805">Pg 1805</a></span>
her out of the country. The consul requests his mother-in-law
to clear some part of the house, into which Hispala might remove;
accordingly, an apartment was assigned her in the
upper part of it, of which the stairs, opening into the street,
were stopped up, and the entrance made from the inner court.
Thither all Fecenia&#8217;s effects were immediately removed, and
her domestics sent for. &AElig;butius, also, was ordered to remove
to the house of one of the consul&#8217;s clients.</p>

<p>When both the informers were by these means in his power,
Postumius represented the affair to the senate, laying before
them the whole circumstance, in due order; the information
given to him at first, and the discoveries gained by his inquiries
afterwards. Great consternation seized on the senators; not
only on the public account, lest such conspiracies and nightly
meetings might be productive of secret treachery and mischief,
but, likewise, on account of their own particular
families, lest some of their relations might be involved in this
infamous affair. The senate voted, however, that thanks
should be given to the consul because he had investigated the
matter with singular diligence, and without exciting any
alarm. They then commit to the consuls the holding an inquiry,
out of the common course, concerning the Bacchanals
and their nocturnal orgies. They order them to take care
that the informers, &AElig;butius and Fecenia, might suffer no
injury on that account; and to invite other informers in the
matter, by offering rewards. They ordered that the officials
in those rites, whether men or women, should be sought for,
not only at Rome, but also throughout all the market towns
and places of assembly, and be delivered over to the power of
the consuls; and also that proclamation should be made in
the city of Rome, and published through all Italy, that &#8220;no
persons initiated in the Bacchanalian rites should presume to
come together or assemble on account of those rites, or to
perform any such kind of worship;&#8221; and above all, that
search should be made for those who had assembled or conspired
for personal abuse, or for any other flagitious practices.
The senate passed these decrees. The consuls directed the
curule &aelig;diles to make strict inquiry after all the priests of
those mysteries, and to keep such as they could apprehend in
custody until their trial; they at the same time charged the
plebeian &aelig;diles to take care that no religious ceremonies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1806" id="Page_1806">Pg 1806</a></span>
should be performed in private. To the capital triumvirs
the task was assigned to post watches in proper places of the
city, and to use vigilance in preventing any meetings by night.
In order likewise to guard against fires, five assistants were
joined to the triumvirs, so that each might have the charge
of the buildings in his own separate district, on this side the
Tiber.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c15" name="c15"></a>15</span>
After despatching these officers to their several employments,
the consuls mounted the rostrum; and, having
summoned an assembly of the people, one of the consuls,
when he had finished the solemn form of prayer which the
magistrates are accustomed to pronounce before they address
the people, proceeded thus: &#8220;Romans, to no former assembly
was this solemn supplication to the gods more suitable or
even more necessary: as it serves to remind you, that these
are the deities whom your forefathers pointed out as the
objects of your worship, veneration, and prayers: and not
those which infatuated men&#8217;s minds with corrupt and foreign
modes of religion, and drove them, as if goaded by the furies,
to every lust and every vice. I am at a loss to know what I
should conceal, or how far I ought to speak out; for I dread
lest, if I leave you ignorant of any particular, I should give
room for carelessness, or if I disclose the whole, that I should
too much awaken your fears. Whatever I shall say, be assured
that it is less than the magnitude and atrociousness of
the affair would justify: exertions will be used by us that it
may be sufficient to set us properly on our guard. That the
Bacchanalian rites have subsisted for some time past in every
country in Italy, and are at present performed in many parts
of this city also, I am sure you must have been informed, not
only by report, but by the nightly noises and horrid yells that
resound through the whole city; but still you are ignorant of
the nature of that business. Part of you think it is some
kind of worship of the gods; others, some excusable sport
and amusement, and that, whatever it may be, it concerns but
a few. As regards the number, if I tell you that they are
many thousands, that you would be immediately terrified to
excess is a necessary consequence; unless I further acquaint
you who and what sort of persons they are. First, then, a great
part of them are women, and this was the source of the evil;
the rest are males, but nearly resembling women; actors and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1807" id="Page_1807">Pg 1807</a></span>
pathics in the vilest lewdness; night revellers, driven frantic
by wine, noise of instruments, and clamours. The conspiracy,
as yet, has no strength; but it has abundant means of acquiring
strength, for they are becoming more numerous every
day. Your ancestors would not allow that you should ever
assemble casually, without some good reason; that is, either
when the standard was erected on the Janiculum, and the
army led out on occasion of elections; or when the tribunes
proclaimed a meeting of the commons, or some of the magistrates
summoned you to it. And they judged it necessary,
that wherever a multitude was, there should be a lawful
governor of that multitude present. Of what kind do you
suppose are the meetings of these people? In the first
place, held in the night, and in the next, composed promiscuously
of men and women. If you knew at what ages
the males are initiated, you would feel not only pity but also
shame for them. Romans, can you think youths initiated,
under such oaths as theirs, are fit to be made soldiers? That
arms should be intrusted with wretches brought out of that
temple of obscenity? Shall these, contaminated with their
own foul debaucheries and those of others, be champions for
the chastity of your wives and children?</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c16" name="c16"></a>16</span>
&#8220;But the mischief were less, if they were only effeminated
by their practices; of that the disgrace would chiefly
affect themselves; if they refrained their hands from outrage,
and their thoughts from fraud. But never was there in the
state an evil of so great magnitude, or one that extended to
so many persons or so many acts of wickedness. Whatever
deeds of villany have, during late years, been committed
through lust; whatever, through fraud; whatever, through
violence; they have all, be assured, proceeded from that
association alone. They have not yet perpetrated all the
crimes for which they combined. The impious assembly at
present confines itself to outrages on private citizens; because
it has not yet acquired force sufficient to crush the commonwealth:
but the evil increases and spreads daily; it is already
too great for the private ranks of life to contain it, and aims
Us views at the body of the state. Unless you take timely
precautions, Romans, their nightly assembly may become as
large as this, held in open day, and legally summoned by a
consul. Now they one by one dread you collected together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1808" id="Page_1808">Pg 1808</a></span>
in the assembly; presently, when you shall have separated
and retired to your several dwellings, in town and country,
they will again come together, and will hold a consultation
on the means of their own safety, and, at the same time, of
your destruction. Thus united, they will cause terror to
every one of you. Each of you, therefore, ought to pray that
his kindred may have behaved with wisdom and prudence;
and if lust, if madness, has dragged any of them into that
abyss, to consider such a person as the relation of those with
whom he has conspired for every disgraceful and reckless act,
and not as one of your own. I am not secure, lest some, even
of yourselves, may have erred through mistake; for nothing
is more deceptive in appearance than false religion. When
the authority of the gods is held out as a pretext to cover
vice, fear enters our minds, lest, in punishing the crimes of
men, we may violate some divine right connected therewith.
Numberless decisions of the pontiffs, decrees of the senate,
and even answers of the aruspices, free you from religious
scruples of this character. How often in the ages of our
fathers was it given in charge to the magistrates, to prohibit
the performance of any foreign religious rites; to banish
strolling sacrificers and soothsayers from the forum, the circus,
and the city; to search for, and burn, books of divination;
and to abolish every mode of sacrificing that was not
conformable to the Roman practice! For they, completely
versed in every divine and human law, maintained, that
nothing tended so strongly to the subversion of religion as
sacrifice, when we offered it not after the institutions of our
forefathers, but after foreign customs. Thus much I thought
necessary to mention to you beforehand, that no vain scruple
might disturb your minds when you should see us demolishing
the places resorted to by the Bacchanalians, and dispersing
their impious assemblies. We shall do all these
things with the favour and approbation of the gods; who,
because they were indignant that their divinity was dishonoured
by those people&#8217;s lusts and crimes, have drawn
forth their proceedings from hidden darkness into the open
light; and who have directed them to be exposed, not that
they may escape with impunity, but in order that they may
be punished and suppressed. The senate have committed to
me and my colleague, an inquisition extraordinary concerning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1809" id="Page_1809">Pg 1809</a></span>
that affair. What is requisite to be done by ourselves, in
person, we will do with energy. The charge of posting
watches through the city, during the night, we have committed
to the inferior magistrates; and, for your parts, it is
incumbent on you to execute vigorously whatever duties are
assigned you, and in the several places where each will be
placed, to perform whatever orders you shall receive, and to
use your best endeavours that no danger or tumult may arise
from the treachery of the party involved in the guilt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c17" name="c17"></a>17</span>
They then ordered the decrees of the senate to be read,
and published a reward for any discoverer who should bring
any of the guilty before them, or give information against
any of the absent, adding, that &#8220;if any person accused should
fly&#8221;, they would limit a certain day upon which, if he did not
answer when summoned, he would be condemned in his
absence; and if any one should be charged who was out of
Italy, they would allow him a longer time, if he should wish
to come and make his defence.&#8221; They then issued an edict,
that &#8220;no person whatever should presume to buy or sell any
thing for the purpose of leaving the country; or to receive
or conceal, or by any means aid the fugitives.&#8221; On the
assembly being dismissed, great terror spread throughout
the city; nor was it confined merely within the walls, or to
the Roman territory, for every where throughout the whole
of Italy alarm began to be felt, when the letters from the
guest-friends were received, concerning the decree of the
senate, and what passed in the assembly, and the edict of the
consuls. During the night, which succeeded the day in
which the affair was made public, great numbers, attempting
to fly, were seized, and brought back by the triumvirs, who
had posted guards at all the gates; and informations were
lodged against many, some of whom, both men and women,
put themselves to death. Above seven thousand men and
women are said to have taken the oath of the association.
But it appeared that the heads of the conspiracy were the
two Catinii, Marcus and Caius, Roman plebeians; Lucius
Opiturnius, a Faliscian; and Minius Cerrinius, a Campanian:
that from these proceeded all their criminal practices, and
that these, were the chief priests and founders of the sect.
Care was taken that they should be apprehended as soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1810" id="Page_1810">Pg 1810</a></span>
possible. They were brought before the consuls, and, confessing
their guilt, caused no delay to the ends of justice.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c18" name="c18"></a>18</span>
But so great were the numbers that fled from the city,
that because the lawsuits and property of many persons were
going to ruin, the pr&aelig;tors, Titus M&aelig;nius and Marcus
Licinius, were obliged, under the direction of the senate, to
adjourn their courts for thirty days, until the inquiries should
be finished by the consuls. The same deserted state of the
law-courts, since the persons, against whom charges were
brought, did not appear to answer, nor could be found in
Rome, necessitated the consuls to make a circuit of the
country towns, and there to make their inquisitions and hold
the trials. Those who, as it appeared, had been only initiated,
and had made after the priest, and in the most solemn
form, the prescribed imprecations, in which the accursed conspiracy
for the perpetration of every crime and lust was
contained, but who had not themselves committed, or compelled
others to commit, any of those acts to which they were
bound by the oath,&mdash;all such they left in prison. But those
who had forcibly committed personal defilements or murders,
or were stained with the guilt of false evidence, counterfeit
seals, forged wills, or other frauds, all these they punished
with death. A greater number were executed than thrown
into prison; indeed, the multitude of men and women who
suffered in both ways, was very considerable. The consuls
delivered the women, who were condemned, to their relations,
or to those under whose guardianship they were, that they
might inflict the punishment in private; but if there did not
appear any proper person of the kind to execute the sentence,
the punishment was inflicted in public. A charge was then
given to demolish all the places where the Bacchanalians had
held their meetings; first, in Rome, and then throughout all
Italy; excepting those wherein should be found some ancient
altar, or consecrated statue. With regard to the future, the
senate passed a decree, &#8220;that no Bacchanalian rites should
be celebrated in Rome or in Italy:&#8221; and ordering that, &#8220;in
case any person should believe some such kind of worship
incumbent on him, and necessary; and that he could not,
without offence to religion, and incurring guilt, omit it, he
should represent this to the city pr&aelig;tor, and the pr&aelig;tor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1811" id="Page_1811">Pg 1811</a></span>
should lay the business before the senate. If permission
were granted by the senate, when not less than one hundred
members were present, then he might perform those rites,
provided that no more than five persons should be present at
the sacrifice, and that they should have no common stock of
money, nor any president of the ceremonies, nor priest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c19" name="c19"></a>19</span>
Another decree connected with this was then made,
on a motion of the consul, Quintus Marcius, that &#8220;the business
respecting the persons who had served the consuls as
informers should be proposed to the senate in its original
form, when Spurius Postumius should have finished his
inquiries, and returned to Rome.&#8221; They voted that Minius
Cerrinius, the Campanian, should be sent to Ardea, to be
kept in custody there; and that a caution should be given to
the magistrates of that city, to guard him with more than
ordinary care, so as to prevent not only his escaping, but his
having an opportunity of committing suicide. Spurius Postumius
some time after came to Rome, and on his proposing
the question, concerning the reward to be given to Publius
&AElig;butius and Hispala Fecenia, because the Bacchanalian
ceremonies were discovered by their exertions, the senate
passed a vote, that &#8220;the city qu&aelig;stors should give to each of
them, out of the public treasury, one hundred thousand <i>asses</i>;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
and that the consuls should desire the plebeian tribunes to
propose to the commons as soon as convenient, that the campaigns
of Publius &AElig;butius should be considered as served,
that he should not become a soldier against his wishes, nor
should any censor assign him a horse<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> at the public charge.&#8221;
They voted also, that &#8220;Hispala Fecenia should enjoy the
privileges of alienating her property by gift or deed; of
marrying out of her rank, and of choosing a guardian, as if a
husband had conferred them by will; that she should be at
liberty to wed a man of honourable birth, and that there
should be no disgrace or ignominy to him who should marry
her; and that the consuls and pr&aelig;tors then in office, and
their successors, should take care that no injury should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1812" id="Page_1812">Pg 1812</a></span>offered to that woman, and that she might live in safety.
That the senate wished, and thought proper, that all these
things should be so ordered.&#8221;&mdash;All these particulars were proposed
to the commons, and executed, according to the vote of
the senate; and full permission was given to the consuls to
determine respecting the impunity and rewards of the other
informers.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c20" name="c20"></a>20</span>
Quintus Marcius, having completed the inquiries in his
district, prepared at length to proceed into the province of
Liguria, for the service of which he received a supply of three
thousand Roman foot and one hundred and fifty horse, with
five thousand Latin foot and two hundred horse. The same
province, and the same numbers of horse and foot, had been
voted to his colleague, and they received the armies which,
during the preceding year, the consuls, Caius Flaminius and
Marcus &AElig;milius, had commanded. They were also ordered,
by a decree of the senate, to raise two new legions, and they
demanded from the allies and Latins twenty thousand foot
and one thousand three hundred horse; besides, they levied
three thousand Roman foot and two hundred horse. It was
resolved that all this army, except the legions, should be led
to reinforce the army in Spain. The consuls, therefore, while
they themselves were engaged in the inquisitions, appointed
Titus M&aelig;nius to hold the levy. When the trials were
finished, Quintus Marcius first marched against the Apuan
Ligurians. While he pursued these into very remote fastnesses,
which had always served them as lurking-places and
receptacles, he was surrounded in a disadvantageous position,
a narrow defile which the enemy had previously seized. Here
four thousand soldiers fell, and three standards of the second
legion, with eleven ensigns of the Latin allies, were taken;
abundance of arms were likewise lost, which were thrown
away by the men in every direction, because they impeded
their flight through the woody paths. The Ligurians ceased
to pursue, sooner than the Romans to fly. As soon as the
consul had effected his escape out of the enemy&#8217;s territories,
he disbanded the troops, in the country of their friends, in
order that the greatness of the loss sustained might not
appear. But he could not obliterate all memorial of his misconduct;
for the pass, from which the Ligurians put him to
flight, has been called the Marcian pass.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1813" id="Page_1813">Pg 1813</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c21" name="c21"></a>21</span>
A little before this intelligence from the war in Liguria
was made public, a letter from Spain was read to them, which
brought joy mingled with grief. Caius Atinius, who, two
years before, had gone to that province in quality of pr&aelig;tor,
fought in the territory of Asta a pitched battle with the
Lusitanians. About six thousand of the enemy were killed,
the rest routed, driven from the field, and their camp taken.
He then led his legions to attack the town of Asta, which he
took with little more trouble than he met at the camp; but,
having been wounded whilst he was approaching the walls
too incautiously, he died in a few days from the effects of the
wound. When the letter was read, acquainting them with
the propr&aelig;tor&#8217;s death, the senate voted, that a courier should
be sent to overtake the pr&aelig;tor, Caius Calpurnius, at the port
of Luna, and inform him, that the senate thought proper that
he should hasten his journey lest the province should be without
a governor. The person who was sent reached Luna on
the fourth day, but Calpurnius had set out some days before.
In Hither Spain, Lucius Manlius Acidinus, who had come into
that province at the same time when Caius Atinius came
into his, fought a battle with the Celtiberians. They quitted
the field, the victory being undecided with the exception of
this, that the Celtiberians removed their camp from that quarter
on the following night: permission was thus afforded to the
Romans to bury their dead, and collect the spoils. In a few
days after, the Celtiberians, having gathered a large army,
attacked the Romans, near the town of Calaguris. Nothing is
recorded respecting the cause that rendered them weaker after
their numbers were increased, but they were defeated in the
battle; twelve thousand of their men were killed, more than
two thousand taken, and the Roman army got possession of
their camp, and had not a successor, by his arrival, checked
the career of the conqueror, the Celtiberians would have been
completely subdued. Both the new pr&aelig;tors drew off their
armies into winter quarters.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c22" name="c22"></a>22</span>
During the time in which this intelligence was announced
from Spain, the games called Taurilia<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> were celebrated,
during two days, on a religious account. Then Marcus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1814" id="Page_1814">Pg 1814</a></span>Fulvius exhibited games, which he had vowed in the &AElig;tolian
war, and which lasted ten days. Many artists, out of respect
to him, came from Greece on the occasion; and now, for the
first time, the Romans had an opportunity of seeing contests
of wrestlers; they were also presented with a hunt of lions
and panthers; the games were celebrated with almost the
variety and abundance of the present age. The nine days&#8217;
solemnity succeeded, because showers of stones had fallen, for
three days, in Picenum; and fires from heaven were said to
have arisen in various places, and singed the clothes of many
persons by slight flashes. By order of the pontiffs, a supplication,
of one day&#8217;s continuance, was added because the temple
of Ops, in the Capitol, was struck by lightning. The consuls
sacrificed victims of the larger kinds, and purified the city.
At the same time, an account was brought from Umbria, of a
hermaphrodite, twelve years old, being found there. The
consuls wishing to get rid of the prodigy, as it was a fearful
omen, ordered that it should be removed instantly out of the
Roman territory, and put to death. During this year, a body
of Transalpine Gauls came into Venetia, without committing
depredation or hostility, and pitched on a spot for building a
town, not far from that where Aquileia now stands. Ambassadors
were sent from Rome, over the Alps, on this business,
and to them an answer was given that &#8220;they had not
emigrated by the authority of their state, nor did their countrymen
know what they were doing in Italy.&#8221; About this
time Lucius Scipio celebrated games, which he said he had
vowed during the war with Antiochus; they lasted ten days,
and the money was contributed for the purpose by the kings
and states of Asia. Valerius Antias asserts, that, after his
condemnation, and the sale of his effects, he was sent as ambassador
into Asia, to adjust disputes between the kings Antiochus
and Eumenes; that there the money was contributed
for him, and actors collected through Asia: and that after his
embassy, the subject of those games (of which he had made
no mention after the war, in which he asserted that they had
been vowed) was at length introduced in the senate-house.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c23" name="c23"></a>23</span>
As the year was now drawing to a conclusion, Quintus
Marcius, then abroad, was soon to go out of office. Spurius
Postumius, after having conducted the inquisitions with the
utmost care and propriety, held the elections. Appius Claudius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1815" id="Page_1815">Pg 1815</a></span>
Pulcher and Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus were chosen
consuls. Next day, Publius Cornelius Cethegus, Aulus Postumius
Albinus, Caius Afranius Stellio, Caius Atilius Serranus
Lucius Postumius Tempsanus, and Marcus Claudius Marcellus
were elected pr&aelig;tors. Towards the close of the year,
because the consul Spurius Postumius reported that in travelling
along the coasts of Italy, for the purpose of holding
the inquisitions, he had found two colonies deserted, Sipontum
on the upper sea, and Buxentum on the lower; in
pursuance of a decree of the senate, Lucius Scribonus Libo,
Marcus Tuccius, and Cneius Bebius Tamphilus, were appointed
commissioners for conducting colonies thither, by
Titus M&aelig;nius, city pr&aelig;tor. The war with king Perseus and
the Macedonians, which was impending, has not derived its
origin from what most persons imagine, nor from Perseus
himself. The preliminary steps were taken by Philip, and,
if he had lived some time longer, he would himself have carried
on that war. When the conditions of peace were imposed
on him, when he was vanquished, one particular chagrined
him more than all the rest; this was because the liberty of
wreaking his vengeance on such of the Macedonians as had
revolted from him in the course of the war, was taken from
him by the senate; although, because Quintius had left that
point undetermined, when lie was adjusting the articles of pacification,
he had not despaired of the possibility of obtaining it.
Afterwards, on the defeat of Antiochus at Thermopyl&aelig;, the armies
being separated at the time when the consul Acilius carried
on the siege of Heraclea, and Philip besieged Lamia, because
he was ordered to retire from the walls of Lamia, as soon
as Heraclea was taken, and the town was surrendered to the Romans,
he was grievously offended with this circumstance. The
consul, indeed, in some measure, soothed his resentment; for,
when he was hastening to Naupactum, where the &AElig;tolians had
re-assembled after their flight, he gave Philip permission to
make war on Amynander and Athamania; and to annex to his
dominions the cities which the &AElig;tolians had taken from the
Thessalians. Without much difficulty, he expelled Amynander
from Athamania, and got possession of several cities. He
also reduced under his dominion the city of Demetrias, a
place of great strength, and convenient in every respect; with
the whole of the Magnesian state. Afterwards, finding that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1816" id="Page_1816">Pg 1816</a></span>
several cities in Thrace, through an abuse of the liberty which
they had lately acquired, and to which they had not been accustomed,
were distracted by dissensions among their leading
men, he, by uniting himself to the parties that were worsted in
their disputes with their countrymen, made himself master of
them all.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c24" name="c24"></a>24</span>
By these means the king&#8217;s wrath against the Romans
was appeased for the present; but he never abandoned the
project of collecting such a force during peace, as would enable
him to maintain a war, whenever the fortunate occasion should
be offered. He augmented the revenues of his kingdom, not
only out of the produce of the lands and the port duties, but
also he worked the mines, both the old ones which had been
neglected, and new ones which he opened in many places.
Then, (in order to restore the former degree of population,
which had been diminished by the calamities of war,) he
not only caused an increase in the offspring of that generation,
by compelling every one to marry and rear children;
but he transplanted a great multitude of Thracians into
Macedonia, and, during a long suspension of arms, he employed
the utmost assiduity in augmenting, by every possible
means, the strength of his kingdom. Causes afterward occurred,
which served to revive his animosity against the
Romans. Complaints made by the Thessalians and Perrh&aelig;bians,
of his holding possession of their towns, and, by ambassadors
from king Eumenes, of his having forcibly seized the
cities of Thrace, and transplanted great numbers of their people
into Macedonia, had been received in such a manner as
plainly evinced that they were not thought unworthy of attention.
What made the greatest impression on the senate,
was, their having been informed, that Philip aimed at the
possession of &AElig;nus and Maronea; as to the Thessalians, they
regarded them less. Ambassadors came, likewise, from the
Athamanians, complaining not of the loss of a part of their
territory, nor of encroachment on their frontier,&mdash;but that all
Athamania had been brought under the dominion and jurisdiction
of the king. Exiles from Maronea also appeared, who
had been expelled by the king&#8217;s troops, for having supported
the cause of liberty; who reported, that not only Maronea,
but &AElig;nus too, was held in subjection by him. Ambassadors
came from Philip to defend his conduct, who asserted, that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1817" id="Page_1817">Pg 1817</a></span>
nothing bad been done without permission from the Roman
commanders. That &#8220;the states of the Thessalians, Perrh&aelig;bians,
and Magnesians, and the nation of the Athamanians,
with Amynander, had all been engaged in the same cause
with the &AElig;tolians. That after the expulsion of king Antiochus,
the consul, being himself busy in reducing the towns
of &AElig;tolia, had named Philip to subdue those states, and they
remained subject to him in consequence of their being conquered
by his arms.&#8221; The senate, too, that they might not
make any decision concerning the king in his absence, sent
Quintus Cascilius Metellus, Marcus B&aelig;ebius Tamphilus, and
Tiberius Sempronius, ambassadors to adjust those disputes.
Previous to their arrival, a convention of all those states
who had disputes with the king, was summoned to meet at
Tempe in Thessaly.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c25" name="c25"></a>25</span>
When all were seated there, (the Roman ambassadors
in the character of arbitrators, the Thessalians, Perrh&aelig;bians,
and Athamanians professedly as accusers, and Philip as defendant,
to hear the accusations brought against him,) those
who were the heads of the embassies, according to their
several tempers, their favour, or their hatred towards the
king, spoke, some with acrimony, others with mildness.
Philippopolis, Trica, Phaloria, Eurymen&aelig;, and the other
towns in their neighbourhood, became the subject of dispute.
The point in controversy was, whether these towns were the
property of the Thessalians, when they were forcibly taken
from them, and held by the &AElig;tolians, (for from these it was
acknowledged that Philip had received them,) or whether
they were originally belonging to the &AElig;tolians: Acilius
having granted them to the king, on the condition that &#8220;they
had been the property of the &AElig;tolians; and if they had
sided with the &AElig;tolians of their own free will, and not compelled
by violence and arms.&#8221; The question in regard to the
towns of the Perrh&aelig;bians and Magnesians turned on the
same points; for the &AElig;tolians, by holding possession of
them occasionally, had confused the rights of all. To these
particulars, which were matter of discussion, the complaints
of the Thessalians were added, that &#8220;if these towns were now
restored to them, they would come into their hands in a state
of desolation, and depopulated; for besides the loss of inhabitants
through the casualties of war, Philip had carried away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1818" id="Page_1818">Pg 1818</a></span>
five hundred of their young men of the first rank into
Macedonia, and abused their labour by employing them in
servile offices; and had taken pains to render useless whatever
he should be compelled to restore to the Thessalians. That
Thebes in Phthiotis was the only sea-port they had, which
formerly produced much profit and advantage to the inhabitants
of Thessaly; but that Philip, having collected there a
number of ships of burthen, made them steer their course
past Thebes to Demetrias, and turned thither the whole commerce
by sea. That he did not now scruple to offer violence,
even to ambassadors, who, by the law of nations, are every
where held inviolable, but had laid an ambush for theirs who
were going to Titus Quintius, that the Thessalians were in consequence
seized with such dread, that not one of them, even in
their own states, or in the general assemblies of the nation,
ventured to open his lips. For the Romans, the defenders of
their liberty, were far distant; and a severe master close at
their side, debarring them from using the kindness of the
Romans. If speech were not free, what else could be said to
be so: at present, through confidence in the protection of the
ambassadors, they uttered their groans rather than words;
but, unless the Romans would take some precautions that
both the fears of the Greeks bordering on Macedonia and the
arrogance of Philip should be abated, his having been conquered,
and their being set at liberty, would prove utterly
fruitless. Like a restive, unmanageable horse, he required
to be cheeked with a strong bridle.&#8221; These bitter expressions
were used by the last speakers among them; those
who spoke before having endeavoured by mildness to mitigate
his resentment; requesting of him &#8220;that he should pardon
persons pleading in defence of their liberty; that he should,
laying aside the harshness of a master, generally display
himself an ally and friend; that he should imitate the Roman
people, who wished to unite their allies to them by the ties of
affection, rather than of fear.&#8221; When the Thessalians had
finished, the Perrh&aelig;bians pleaded that Gonnocondylos, to
which Philip had given the name of Olympias, belonged to
Perrh&aelig;bia, and ought to be restored to them; and the same
demand was made with respect to Mal&#339;a, and Ericinium.
The Athamanians claimed a restoration of liberty, and the
forts Athen&aelig;us and P&#339;tneus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1819" id="Page_1819">Pg 1819</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c26" name="c26"></a>26</span>
Philip began his discourse also with complaints, that
he might maintain the appearance of an accuser rather than
of a defendant. He complained that &#8220;the Thessalians had
taken by force of arms, Menelais in Dolopia, a town belonging
to his dominions; likewise, Petra in Pieria was taken by the
same Thessalians and the Perrh&aelig;bians; that they had reduced
under their government Xyni&aelig;, which unquestionably belonged
to &AElig;tolia; and that Parachelois, which was under
Athamania, was, without any just claim, subjected to the
jurisdiction of the Thessalians. As to the charges brought
against him, concerning an ambush laid for ambassadors, and
of sea-ports being frequented or deserted, the one was quite
ridiculous, (as if he were to account for what harbours merchants
or sailors should frequent,) and the other the constant
tenor of his conduct rejected with scorn. During a number
of years, ambassadors had never ceased carrying complaints
against him, sometimes to the Roman generals, at others to
Rome to the senate. Which of them had ever been injured,
even in words? They said, indeed, that an ambush was once
laid for some who were going to Quintius, but they are silent
in regard to consequences. Such were the accusations of men
searching for false imputations, because they had no truth on
their side.&#8221; He said, that &#8220;the Thessalians, insolently and
wantonly, abused the indulgence of the Roman people, too
greedily drinking, as it were, strong draughts of liberty after
a long thirst; and thus, in the manner of slaves lately set
free, made trial of their voices and tongues, and prided themselves
in invectives and railings against their masters.&#8221; Then,
hurried on by passion, he added, that &#8220;his sun had not set
yet;&#8221; which expression, not only the Thessalians, but the
Romans also, took as a menace to themselves; and when a
murmur of displeasure followed his words, and was at length
hushed, he replied to the ambassadors of the Perrh&aelig;bians and
Athamanians, &#8220;that the cases of the cities of which they had
spoken were the same. The consul Acilius and the Romans
gave them to him, when they were the property of enemies.
If the donors chose to resume what they had given, he knew
he must submit, but in that case they would, for the gratification
of inconstant and unprofitable allies, do injury to a
more useful and more faithful friend. For no favour produced
less permanent gratitude than the gift of liberty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1820" id="Page_1820">Pg 1820</a></span>
especially among people who were ready to corrupt it by
using it badly.&#8221; After examining the merits of the cause,
the ambassadors pronounced their judgment, that &#8220;the Macedonian
garrisons should be withdrawn from the cities in
question, and that the kingdom of Macedonia should be
limited by its ancient boundaries. That with regard to the
injuries which both parties complained of being done to them,
it would be requisite to institute some compact for the attainment
of justice, in order to decide the controversies between
those states and the Macedonians.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c27" name="c27"></a>27</span>
The king being grievously offended, the ambassadors
proceeded thence to Thessalonica, to give a hearing to the
business concerning the cities of Thrace. Here the ambassadors
of Eumenes said, that &#8220;if the Romans wished that
&AElig;nus and Maronea should be independent, the king felt
ashamed to say more, than to recommend it to them to leave
those people free in fact, and not in words; nor to suffer
their kindness to be intercepted by another. But if they had
not so much concern for the states situated in Thrace, it was
much more reasonable that Eumenes should possess, as the
rewards of war, the places which had been under the dominion
of Antiochus, than Philip; and that, either on account
of his father Attalus&#8217;s deserts in the war, waged by the
Roman people against Philip himself, or on account of his
own, because he had shared all the toils and dangers on land
and sea, during the war with Antiochus. Besides, he had the
previous judgment of the ten ambassadors to that purpose;
who, when they granted the Chersonesus and Lysimachia,
surely yielded at the same time &AElig;nus and Maronea; which,
even from the proximity of situation, were but a sort of
appendage to the larger gift. For, as to Philip, by what
merits towards the Roman people, or what right of dominion,
had he put garrisons into those places, which were at so
great a distance from the borders of Macedonia? They then
desired that the Romans would order the Maronites to be
called, from whom they would receive more positive information
of the condition of those cities.&#8221; The Maronite ambassadors
being called in, declared, that &#8220;not in one spot of
the city, as in other garrisoned towns, but in every quarter of
it, there was a party of the king&#8217;s troops, and that Maronea
was full of Macedonians; in consequence of which, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1821" id="Page_1821">Pg 1821</a></span>
favourites of the king domineered over the rest; they alone
had liberty of speaking, either in the senate or assemblies of
the people. All posts of eminence they assumed to themselves,
or conferred on whom they thought proper. That the
most deserving persons, who had a regard for liberty and for
the laws, were either expelled their country, and in exile, or
remained in silence, dishonoured and subjected to men of the
worst description.&#8221; They added also a few words respecting
their right to the frontier places, affirming, that &#8220;Quintus
Fabius Labeo, when he was in that country, had fixed as a
boundary line to Philip, the old royal road leading to Paroreia,
in Thrace, which in no place leads towards the sea; and
that Philip afterwards drew a new one in another direction,
in order to include the cities and lands of the Maronites.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c28" name="c28"></a>28</span>
Philip, in his reply to these charges, took quite another
course than when lately answering the Thessalians and Perrh&aelig;bians,
and said:&mdash;&#8220;My dispute is not now with the Maronites,
or with Eumenes, but with you yourselves, Romans, from
whom I have long ago seen that I can obtain no justice. The
cities of Macedonia, which had revolted from me during a suspension
of arms, I thought should in justice be restored to me;
not that they would have made any great accession to my dominions,
because the towns are small in themselves, and besides,
are situated on the extremities of the frontiers; but
because the example was of great consequence towards retaining
the rest of the Macedonians in their allegiance. This
was refused me. In the &AElig;tolian war, I was ordered by the
consul, Manius Acilius, to lay siege to Lamia, and when I had
there undergone a long course of fatigue in fighting and constructing
works, and was on the point of mounting the walls,
the consul recalled me from the city when almost in my possession,
and compelled me to draw off my troops from it. As
some consolation for this hard treatment, I received permission
to seize on some forts, rather than cities, of Thessaly,
Perrh&aelig;bia, and Athamania. These also you yourselves,
Quintus C&aelig;cilius, have taken from me a few days ago. The
ambassadors of Eumenes, just now, took for granted, it
seems, that Eumenes would with more justice than I possess
whatever belonged to Antiochus. I judge the matter to be
widely different. For Eumenes could not have remained on
his throne, unless the Romans had engaged in the war, and
not unless they had conquered. Therefore he has received a favour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1822" id="Page_1822">Pg 1822</a></span>
from you, not you from him; whereas, so far were any part
of my dominions from being in danger, that, when Antiochus
voluntarily offered to purchase my alliance, with three thousand
talents and fifty decked ships, guaranteeing to me all the
cities of Greece of which I had heretofore been in possession,
I rejected that offer. I avowed myself his enemy, even before
Manius Acilius brought over an army into Greece. In conjunction
with that consul, I supported whatever share of the
war he gave me in charge. To the succeeding consul, Lucius
Scipio, when he proposed leading his army by land to the
Hellespont, I not only gave a passage through my dominions,
but also made roads for him, built bridges, supplied him
with provisions, and escorted him, not only through Macedon,
but likewise through Thrace; where, besides other business,
I had to procure peace from the barbarians. In requital of
this zeal, not to call it merit, towards you, whether would it
be proper in you, Romans, to enlarge and increase my dominions
by acts of generosity, or to ravish from me what I
possessed, either in my own right or through your kindness.
The cities of Macedon, which you acknowledge to have belonged
to my kingdom, are not restored. Eumenes comes to
plunder me as he would Antiochus, and, if you choose to believe
him, covers his most shameless chicanery under the
decree of the ten ambassadors, by which principally he can be
refuted and convicted. For is it not expressly and plainly set
down in that writing, that the Chersonese and Lysimachia are
granted to Eumenes; and where are &AElig;nus, Maronea, and the
cities of Thrace annexed to it in writing? That which he
did not dare even to ask from them, shall he obtain from you,
as if under their grant? It is a matter of importance in what
light you choose to consider me. If you are resolved to persecute
me as an enemy and foe, proceed to act as you have
begun: but, if you have any consideration for me as a king
in friendship and alliance with you, I must entreat you not to
judge me deserving of such injurious treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c29" name="c29"></a>29</span>
The king&#8217;s discourse made a considerable impression
on the ambassadors; they therefore left the matter in suspense,
by this indecisive resolution, that &#8220;if the cities in question
were granted to Eumenes by the decree of the ten ambassadors,
they would make no alteration. If Philip subdued
them in war, he should, by the laws of war, hold them as the
prize of victory. If neither were the case, then their judgment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1823" id="Page_1823">Pg 1823</a></span>
was, that the decision should be referred to the senate;
and in order that all things might remain in their original
state, the garrisons in those cities should be withdrawn.&#8221;
These causes, principally, alienated the regard of Philip from
the Romans, so that the war naturally seems not set on foot
by his son Perseus for any fresh causes, but rather for these
causes, bequeathed by the father to the son. At Rome there
was hitherto no suspicion of a war with Macedonia. Lucius
Manlius, the proconsul, had by this time come home from Spain.
On his demanding a triumph from the senate assembled in the
temple of Bellona, the greatness of his exploits justified the
demand, but precedent opposed it; for it was a rule, established
by ancient practice, that no commander, who had not
brought home his troops, should triumph, unless he had delivered
up the province to his successor, in a state of thorough
subjection and tranquillity. An honour of a middling grade was
conferred on Manlius, namely, that he should enter the city in
ovation. He carried in the procession fifty-two golden crowns,
one hundred and twenty-two pounds&#8217; weight of gold, with sixteen
thousand three hundred pounds of silver; and announced
in the senate, that his qu&aelig;stor, Quintus Fabius, was bringing
ten thousand pounds&#8217; weight of silver, and eighty of gold, and
that he would carry it likewise to the treasury. During that
year there was a formidable insurrection of the slaves in Apulia.
Lucius Postumius, pr&aelig;tor, governed the province of Tarentum,
and conducted with much severity inquiries into a conspiracy
of peasants, who had infested the roads and public pastures
with robberies. Of these, he passed sentence on no less than
seven thousand; many of whom made their escape, and on
many punishment was inflicted. The consuls, after being
long detained in the city by the levies, set out at length for
their provinces.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c30" name="c30"></a>30</span>
This year, Caius Calpurnius and Lucius Quintius, the
two pr&aelig;tors in Spain, drew their troops out of winter quarters,
at the commencement of spring, and making a junction of
them in B&aelig;turia, for they were resolved to proceed in the operations
of the campaign with united zeal and harmony, advanced
into Carpetania, where the enemy&#8217;s camp lay. At a small distance
from the towns of Hippo and Toletum, a fight began
between the foraging parties, to whom when reinforcements
came from both armies from the camps, the entire armies were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1824" id="Page_1824">Pg 1824</a></span>
by degrees drawn out into the field. In this irregular kind
of battle, the advantage of the ground and the manner of
fighting were in favour of the enemy. The two Roman armies
were routed, and driven into their camp; but the enemy
did not pursue the dismayed Romans. The Roman prætors,
lest their camp should be attacked next day, giving the signal
in silence, led away their army in the dead of the following
night. At the first dawn, the Spaniards came up to the
rampart in battle array, and entered the camp which, beyond
their expectation, was deserted, and made prey of whatever
had in the hurry and confusion been first left behind; and
then, returning to their own station, remained, for a few days,
at rest within their camp. Of the Romans and allies, there
were killed in the battle and the pursuit, five thousand men,
out of whose spoils the enemy furnished themselves with arms.
They then advanced to the river Tagus. All the intermediate
time the Roman prætors employed in collecting aid from the
allied Spanish states, and reviving the spirits of their men
after the dismay occasioned by their defeat. When their
strength appeared adequate, and the soldiers too called for
their enemy, to blot out in vengeance their former disgrace,
they pitched their camp at the distance of twelve miles from
the river Tagus; but decamping thence at the third watch,
and marching with their army in a square, reached the bank
of the river at break of day. The enemy&#8217;s camp was on a
hill at the other side of the river. They immediately led their
army across the river where it was fordable in two places,
Calpurnius having the command of the right, Quintius of the
left. The enemy continued motionless, since they were surprised
at the sudden arrival of the Romans, and busy in consultations,
when they might have excited confusion among the
troops during their hurry in passing the river. In the mean
time the Romans brought over all their baggage, and threw
it together in a heap, and seeing the enemy, at length,
begin to move, and having no time for fortifying a camp, they
formed their line of battle. In the centre were placed the fifth
legion, serving under Calpurnius, and the eighth, under Quintius,
which composed the principal strength of their army.
All the way to the enemy&#8217;s camp they had an open plain, free
from all danger of ambush.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c31" name="c31"></a>31</span>
When the Spaniards saw the two bodies of Romans, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1825" id="Page_1825">Pg 1825</a></span>
their side of the river, they rushed suddenly out of the camp,
and advanced to battle at full speed, that they might fall upon
them before they should unite and put themselves in order.
The fight, in the beginning, was urged with great fury; the
Spaniards being elated by their late success, and the Roman
soldiery inflamed to rage, by a discomfiture to which they were
unaccustomed. The centre, consisting of two legions of the
greatest bravery, fought with the utmost vigour. The enemy,
seeing that they could not be forced from their ground by any
other means, resolved to make their attack in form of a wedge;
and this body, becoming continually more numerous and more
compact, pressed hard on them. When the pr&aelig;tor, Calpurnius,
perceived that his line was distressed in this part, he
hastily despatched two lieutenants-general, Titus Quintilius
Varus and Lucius Juventius Thalna, to animate the courage
of the two legions, who were ordered to say, that &#8220;all hopes
of victory, and of retaining possession of Spain, depended entirely
on them. If they should give ground, not a man in
that whole army would ever see Italy, no, nor even the farther
bank of the Tagus.&#8221; He himself, at the head of the cavalry
of the two legions, making a small circuit, charged the flank
of the wedge, which was pressing upon his centre. Quintius,
likewise, with his cavalry, charged the enemy on the other
flank; but the horsemen of Calpurnius fought with far
greater spirit, while the pr&aelig;tor himself exceeded all others.
He was the first that struck down one of the enemy, and he
pushed in among the troops in the centre, in such a manner
that it was hard to distinguish to which side he belonged.
Thus the horse were animated by the extraordinary valour of
the pr&aelig;tor, and the infantry by that of the horse. Shame,
because they saw the pr&aelig;tor in the midst of the enemy&#8217;s
weapons, inspired the foremost centurions. They all, therefore,
earnestly pressed the standard-bearers, urging them to
carry forward the ensigns, and the soldiers to follow with
speed. All set up the shout anew, and made an attack as
violent as if it were made from the higher ground. Like a
flood, therefore, they broke and bore down the enemy in dismay,
nor could they be resisted, pouring in one after another,
The cavalry pursued the fugitives to their camp, and mixing
with the crowd of the runaways, penetrated within the rampart.
Here the fight was renewed by the troops left to guard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1826" id="Page_1826">Pg 1826</a></span>
the camp, and the Roman horsemen were obliged to dismount.
While they were engaged, the fifth legion came up, and afterwards
the rest of the troops joined them with all the speed they
could. The Spaniards were cut to pieces in all parts of the
camp; not more than four thousand men made their escape.
Of these about three thousand, who kept their arms, took
possession of a mountain in the neighbourhood, and one thousand,
who were in general but half armed, dispersed through
the country. This army of the enemy had contained thirty-five
thousand men, of whom that very small number survived
the battle. One hundred and thirty-three standards were
taken. Of the Romans and allies, a few more than six
hundred fell; and of the provincial auxiliaries, about one
hundred and fifty. The loss of five military tribunes, and a
few Roman horsemen, served principally to give the victory
the appearance of being a bloody one. The army lodged in the
enemy&#8217;s camp, as they had not had time to fortify one of their
own. Next day the cavalry was praised by Calpurnius in an
assembly, and presented with trappings; and he declared publicly,
that through their bravery, principally, the enemy had
been defeated, and their camp stormed and taken. Quinctius,
the other pr&aelig;tor, presented his cavalry also with chains and
clasps. A great many centurions also, of both the armies,
received gratuities, especially those who were in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c32" name="c32"></a>32</span>
The consuls, as soon as they had finished the levies,
and other business which required to be done at Rome, led
the army into their province, Liguria. Sempronius marched
from Pis&aelig; against the Apuan Ligurians, and by ravaging their
lands, and by burning their villages and forts, he opened that
difficult country, as far as the river Macra and the harbour of
Luna. The enemy took possession of a mountain which had
been the ancient retreat of their forefathers; but the difficulty
of access being overcome, they were dislodged by force.
Appius Claudius, against the Ingaunian tribe, rivalled in
several successful battles the good fortune and bravery of his
colleague. He also stormed six of their towns, in which he
made many thousand prisoners, beheading forty-three of the
chief promoters of the war. The time of the elections now
drew near; but Claudius came home to Rome sooner than
Sempronius, to whom the business of presiding at the elections
had been allotted, because his brother, Publius Claudius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1827" id="Page_1827">Pg 1827</a></span>
stood candidate for the consulship. His competitors, of patrician
rank, were Lucius &AElig;milius, Quintus Fabius Labeo, and
Servius Sulpicius Galba, who had been candidates before,
and now renewed their suit, for an honour which was the
more justly due to them, owing to their repulses, as it had
been refused before. Besides, as it was not lawful that more
than one patrician should be appointed, there was a closer
contest between the four candidates. The plebeian candidates
likewise were men in high esteem. Lucius Porcius, Quintus
Terentius Culleo, and Cneius B&aelig;bius Tamphilus; these two
had been disappointed, but had cherished hopes of attaining
the honour at some future time. Claudius was the only new
candidate. Quintus Fabius Labeo and Lucius Porcius Licinus
were marked out by public opinion as the successful persons;
but Claudius, the consul, unattended by his lictors, canvassed
with his brother through all parts of the forum, notwithstanding
the loud remonstrances of his opponents and the
greater part of the senate, who insisted that &#8220;he ought to
remember that he was consul of the Roman people, rather
than the brother of Publius Claudius. Why should he not
rather sit on his tribunal, content himself with presiding, and
remain a silent spectator of the business.&#8221; Yet he could not
be restrained from a display of his immoderate zeal. The
election was, also, several times interrupted by contentions
between the plebeian tribunes; some of whom struggled hard
in opposition to the consul, and others in support of the cause
which he favoured. At last, Appius conquered all opposition,
so as to set aside Fabius, and bring in his brother. Thus was
Publius Claudius Pulcher elected consul, beyond his own,
and indeed the general expectation. Lucius Porcius Licinus
carried his election also, because the contest among the plebeian
candidates was conducted with a decent degree of
warmth, and not with the violence of Claudius. Then was
held the election of pr&aelig;tors. Caius Decimius Flavus, Publius
Sempronius Longus, Publius Cornelius Cethegus, Quintus
N&aelig;vius Matho, Caius Sempronius Bl&aelig;sus, and Aulus Terentius
Varro, were made pr&aelig;tors. Such were the occurrences
at home and abroad of this year, during the consulate of
Appius Claudius and Marcus Sempronius.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c33" name="c33"></a>33</span>
In the beginning of the following year, Publius Claudius
and Lucius Porcius, the consuls, when Quintus C&aelig;cilius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1828" id="Page_1828">Pg 1828</a></span>
Marcus B&aelig;ebius, and Tiberius Sempronius, who had been sent
to adjust the matters in dispute between the kings, Philip and
Eumenes, and the states of the Thessalians, had given an
account of their embassy, introduced to the senate ambassadors
from those kings and states. On this occasion, the same
arguments were repeated by all parties, which had been urged
before the ambassadors in Greece. The senate then decreed
that a new embassy, the principal man of which was Appius
Claudius, should be sent into Macedonia and Greece, to know
whether the several states had been restored to the Rhodians,
Thessalians, and Perrh&aelig;bians. Instructions were given to
the same, that the garrisons should be withdrawn, from &AElig;nus
and Maronea, and that all the sea-coast of Thrace should be
made free and independent of Philip and the Macedonians.
They were ordered also to go to Peloponnesus, from which
the former ambassadors had departed, leaving affairs in a
more unsettled state than they would have been if they had
not come thither. For besides other matters, they were even
sent away without an answer by the Ach&aelig;an council, nor was
an audience of that body granted to them at their request.
When Quintus C&aelig;cilius made a heavy complaint on this subject,
and at the same time the Laced&aelig;monians deplored the demolition
of their walls, the carrying off their poor people into
Achaia, the selling of them there, and the depriving them of
the laws of Lycurgus, by which the nation had been supported
unto that time, the Achaians laboured principally to
excuse their having refused a meeting of the council by quoting
a law which enacted, that a council should not be summoned,
except on business of peace or war, or when ambassadors
should come from the senate with letters or written
instructions. That this kind of excuse should not be made
in future, the senate observed to them, that they ought to
take care that Roman ambassadors should at all times have
an opportunity of applying to their council, in like manner
as an audience of the senate was always given to them, at
any time when they wished it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c34" name="c34"></a>34</span>
After those embassies were dismissed, Philip, being
informed that he must yield up the states, and evacuate the
towns in question, was highly enraged against all, yet vented
his fury on the Maronites in particular. He gave a charge
to Onomastus, who had the command of the sea-coast, to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1829" id="Page_1829">Pg 1829</a></span>
to death the leaders of the opposite party. This man, through
the agency of a person called Cassander, a partisan of the
king&#8217;s, who had resided a long time in Maronea, having
introduced Thracians by night, put the inhabitants to the
sword, as if the city had been taken by storm. When the
Roman ambassadors complained of his acting with such
cruelty towards the innocent Maronites, and with such presumption
towards the Roman people, in killing, as enemies,
those very persons to whom the senate had adjudged the
restoration of liberty, he denied that &#8220;any of those matters
concerned him, or any one belonging to him; that they
had quarrelled among themselves, and fought, because some
wished to bring over their state to his side, others to that of
Eumenes. That they might easily ascertain this; and they
had only to ask the Maronites themselves.&#8221; For he was confident,
that while they were all under the impression of
terror, since the late massacre, not one of them would dare to
utter a word against him. Appius said, that &#8220;a case so clear
ought not to be examined into as if it were doubtful. But if
he wished to remove the guilt from himself, let him send
Onomastus and Cassander, the actors in that business, to
Rome, that the senate might examine them.&#8221; At first, these
words so entirely disconcerted the king, that neither his colour
nor his looks remained unchanged; then, after some time,
having collected his thoughts, he replied, that &#8220;he would send
Cassander, who had been in Maronea, if it was their desire:
but as to Onomastus, how could that matter affect him, who,
so far from being in Maronea, was not even near it?&#8221; He
was more careful of Onomastus, as a more valued friend, yet
he dreaded him much more lest he might make discoveries;
because he had, in person, conversed with him on the subject,
and he had made him an agent and accomplice in many
similar acts. Cassander is supposed to have been taken off,
that the truth might not be divulged, by poison administered
by persons sent to escort him through Epirus to the sea-coast.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c35" name="c35"></a>35</span>
The ambassadors departed from the conference with
Philip in such a manner that they made it manifest that none
of these acts pleased them; and Philip, with a full resolution
to have recourse again to arms. Because his strength was as
yet insufficient for that purpose, he resolved, in order to procure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1830" id="Page_1830">Pg 1830</a></span>
delay, to send his younger son Demetrius to Rome, to
clear him from the above-named charges; and at the same
time to deprecate the wrath of the senate. Philip had strong
expectations that the young man himself, because he had,
while a hostage at Rome, exhibited proofs of a princely disposition,
would have a good deal of influence now. Meanwhile,
under the pretence of carrying succour to the Byzantians,
but in reality with design to strike terror into the
chieftains of the Thracians, he marched into their country,
utterly defeated them in an engagement, in which he took
their commander, Amadocus, prisoner, and then returned to
Macedonia, having first despatched emissaries to induce the
barbarians, living near the Danube, to make an irruption into
Italy. The arrival of the Roman ambassadors, who had been
ordered to go from Macedonia into Achaia, was expected in
Peloponnesus; and in order that the Ach&aelig;ans might settle
their plans of conduct towards them beforehand, their pr&aelig;tor,
Lycortas, summoned a general council. Here the affair of
the Laced&aelig;monians was taken into consideration. It was
observed that &#8220;from enemies, they were turned accusers; and
there was reason to fear lest they should prove more formidable,
after having been conquered, than when at war: for in it
the Ach&aelig;ans had the Romans as allies in their cause; now
the same Romans were more favourable to the Laced&aelig;monians
than to the Achæans. Even Areus and Alcibiades, both restored
from exile through the kindness of the Ach&aelig;ans, had
undertaken an embassy to Rome, in prejudice to a nation to
which they were so much obliged; and had used language so
severe, that they seemed to have been banished from their
country, instead of being restored to it.&#8221; A general clamour
arose, requiring him to put the question on each of them by
name; and as every thing was directed by passion, not by
reason, they were condemned to die. In a few days after this
the Roman ambassadors arrived, and a council was summoned
to meet them at Clitor, in Arcadia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c36" name="c36"></a>36</span>
Before they transacted any business, alarm was excited
in the Ach&aelig;ans, accompanied by the reflection, how unlikely
the dispute was to receive impartial judgment, when they saw
in company with the ambassadors Areus and Alcibiades,
whom in their last council they had condemned to death; yet
none of them dared to utter a word. Appius acquainted them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1831" id="Page_1831">Pg 1831</a></span>
that the senate was much displeased at those matters, of
which the Laced&aelig;monians made complaint before them;
&#8220;first, the massacre that took place at Compasium of those
who, in obedience to the summons of Philop&#339;men, came to
stand a trial; then after such barbarity had been exercised
towards men, that their cruelty might be felt in every part,
the having demolished the wall of that famous city, having
abrogated its laws of the greatest antiquity, and abolished the
discipline of Lycurgus, so famed throughout the world.&#8221;
After Appius had spoken to this effect, Lycortas, both because
he was pr&aelig;tor and because he was of the faction of
Philop&#339;men, the adviser of all that was done at Laced&aelig;emon,
answered him thus: &#8220;Appius Claudius, our speech before
you is attended with more difficulties than we had lately
before the senate at Rome; for then we had to answer the
accusations of the Laced&aelig;monians, but now we stand accused
by yourselves, before whom our cause is to be heard. But to
this disadvantage of situation we submit with this hope, that
you will hear us with the temper of a judge, laying aside the
character of an advocate, in which you just now appeared. I
at least, though the matters of which the Laced&aelig;monians
complained formerly in this place, before Quintus C&aelig;cilius,
and afterwards at Rome, have been just recapitulated by you,
yet shall consider myself as answering for them, not to
you, but before you. You charge us with the murder of
those men, who being called out by the pr&aelig;tor, Philop&#339;men,
to trial, were put to death. This I think a charge of such a
nature, that it ought not to be advanced against us, either by
you, Romans, or by any in your presence. Why so? Because
it was written in the treaty with you, that the Laced&aelig;monians
should not intermeddle with the cities on the coast. At the
time when they, taking up arms, seized by assault in the
night those towns with which they had been forbidden to
interfere; if Titus Quintius, if a Roman army had been in
Peloponnesus, as formerly, the captured and oppressed inhabitants
would surely have fled to them for relief. As you
were at a great distance, to whom else would they fly but to
us, your allies, whom they had seen at a former time bringing
aid to Gythium; whom they had seen in conjunction
with you, besieging Laced&aelig;mon on their account? In your
stead, therefore, we undertook a just and rightful war. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1832" id="Page_1832">Pg 1832</a></span>
when other men approve of this step, and even the Laced&aelig;monians
cannot censure it; the gods themselves, also, by
giving us the victory, have shown their approbation of it;
how then can acts done under the laws of war come under
civil disquisition? Of these acts, however, the greatest part
nowise affect us. The summoning to trial men, who had
excited the populace to arms, who had stormed and plundered
the towns on the coast, who had murdered the principal
inhabitants, was our act; but the putting them to death when
they were coming into the camp was yours, Areus and
Alcibiades, who now, since it is the will of the gods, arraign
us, and not ours. The Laced&aelig;monian exiles (in the number
of whom, these two men then were) were then in our camp,
and believing that they were the objects of attack because
they had chosen the maritime towns for their residence, made
an assault on those by whose means they had been banished,
and who they perceived with indignation would not suffer
them even to grow old in exile with safety. Laced&aelig;nonians
therefore, not Ach&aelig;ans, slew Laced&aelig;monians; nor is it of
any consequence to dispute, whether they were slain justly or
unjustly.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c37" name="c37"></a>37</span>
&#8220;But then, Ach&aelig;ans, the abolition of the laws and
ancient discipline of Lycurgus, with the demolition of the
walls, are unquestionably your acts: now how can both these
charges be brought forward by the same persons, since the
walls of Laced&aelig;mon were built, not by Lycurgus, but a few
years ago, for the purpose of subverting the discipline of
Lycurgus? The tyrants erected them lately as a fortress
and defence for themselves, not for the state; and if Lycurgus
should rise this day from the dead, he would rejoice at their
ruins, and would say that he now acknowledged his country,
and ancient Sparta. You ought not to have waited for
Philop&#339;men, or the Ach&aelig;ans; you should have removed and
razed, with your own hands, every vestige of tyranny; for
these were the foul scars of slavery. And as during almost
eight hundred years, while ye were without walls, ye were
free, and for some time even chiefs of Greece; so, after being
bound with walls, as with fetters, you were slaves for one
hundred years. As to what concerns the abrogating their
laws, I conceive that the tyrants took away the ancient laws
of Laced&aelig;mon, and that we did not deprive them of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1833" id="Page_1833">Pg 1833</a></span>
own laws which they did not possess, but gave them ours;
nor did we neglect the interests of their state, when we made
it a member of our council, and incorporated it with ourselves,
so that the whole Peloponnesus should form one body and
one council. If we were living under laws different from
what we imposed on them, in that case I think they might
complain of being treated unfairly, and consequently be displeased.
I know, Appius Claudius, that the kind of discourse
which I have hitherto used is not proper either for allies,
addressing their allies, or for an independent nation; but, in
truth, for slaves pleading before their masters. For if the
herald&#8217;s proclamation, in which you ordered the Ach&aelig;ans,
first of all the states of Greece, to be free, was any thing more
than empty sound; if the treaty be valid, if the alliance and
friendship be maintained on equal terms, why do not I inquire
what you Romans did, on the taking of Capua, as
well as you demand what we, the Ach&aelig;ans, did towards the
Laced&aelig;monians, when we conquered them in war? Some
persons were killed, suppose, by us. What! did not you behead
the Campanian senators? We demolished their walls:
you not only destroyed the walls, but you took the city and
the lands. But you say, the treaty is on equal terms only in
appearance, but, in reality, the Ach&aelig;ans possess a precarious
state of freedom, while the Romans enjoy supreme power.
I am sensible of it, Appius; and if I ought not, I do not
remonstrate; but, I beseech you, let the difference between
the Romans and Ach&aelig;ans be as great as it may, not to place
people, who are foes to both, on an equal footing with us,
your allies, or even on a better. For, as to setting them on
an equality, that we ourselves have done, when we gave them
our own laws, when we made them members of the Ach&aelig;an
council. Vanquished,&mdash;they are not content with what satisfies
their conquerors; foes,&mdash;they demand more than allies
enjoy. What we have ratified by our oaths, what we have
consecrated as inviolable to eternal remembrance, by records
engraved in stone, they want to abolish, and to load us with
perjury. Romans, for you we have high respect; and, if such
is your wish, dread also; but we more respect and dread the
the immortal gods.&#8221; He was heard with general approbation,
and all declared that he had spoken as became the dignity of
his office; so that it was easily seen, that the Romans could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1834" id="Page_1834">Pg 1834</a></span>
not support their ascendency by acting gently. Appius then
said, that &#8220;he earnestly recommended it to the Ach&aelig;ans to
conciliate friendship, while it was in their power to act voluntarily;
lest they might presently do so unwillingly and by
compulsion.&#8221; These words were heard by all with grief, but
inspired them with fear of refusing compliance. They only
requested the Romans &#8220;to make such alterations respecting
the Laced&aelig;monians as they should judge proper, and not involve
the Ach&aelig;ans in the guilt of annulling what they had
sanctioned with their oaths.&#8221; Nothing more was done, only
the sentence lately passed on Areus and Alcibiades was reversed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c38" name="c38"></a>38</span>
In the beginning of this year, when the business of
assigning the provinces to the consuls and pr&aelig;tors was taken
under consideration at Rome, Liguria was decreed to the consuls,
because there was no war any where else. As to the
pr&aelig;tors, Caius Decimius Flavus obtained, by lot, the city
jurisdiction; Publius Cornelius Cethegus, that between citizens
and foreigners; Caius Sempronius Bl&aelig;sus, Sicily; Quintus
N&aelig;vius Matho, Sardinia; he had also the charge of
making inquisition concerning poisons; Aulus Terentius
Varro, Hither Spain; and Publius Sempronius Longus, Farther
Spain. From the two latter provinces deputies arrived
about this time,&mdash;Lucius Juvencius Thalna and Titus Quintilius
Varus; who, having informed the senate how formidable
the war was that was finished by them in Spain, requested
that, in consideration of such happy success, a thanksgiving
should be performed to the immortal gods, and permission
granted to the pr&aelig;tors to bring home the armies. The senate
decreed a thanksgiving for two days, and ordered that the
question respecting the armies should lie over, and be proposed
when they would be deliberating concerning the armies
for the consuls and pr&aelig;tors. A few days after this, they voted
to the consuls, for Liguria, two legions each, which Appius
Claudius and Marcus Sempronius had commanded. With
regard to the armies in Spain, there was a warm contention
between the new pr&aelig;tors and the friends of the absent ones,
Calpurnius and Quintius. On each side were plebeian tribunes,
and, on each, a consul. The former threatened, if the
senate voted for bringing home the armies, to protest against
their decree; the latter, that, if such a protest were made,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1835" id="Page_1835">Pg 1835</a></span>
they would not suffer any other business to proceed. At last,
the interest of the absent pr&aelig;tors was overpowered, and a
decree of the senate passed, that &#8220;the pr&aelig;tors should enlist
four thousand Roman foot, and four hundred horse; with five
thousand foot, and five hundred horse, of the Latin confederates;
whom they should carry with them into Spain. That,
when they should have divided these between the legions,
they should discharge whatever number should then be in
each legion, above five thousand foot and three hundred horse,
dismissing those first who had served out their number of
campaigns, afterwards the others according to their bravery
displayed under Calpurnius and Quintius.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c39" name="c39"></a>39</span>
After this dispute was ended, another immediately
arose, in consequence of the death of a pr&aelig;tor, Caius Decimius.
There stood candidates for his place, Cneius Sicinius
and Lucius Pupius, who had been &aelig;diles the year before;
Caius Valerius, the flamen of Jupiter, and Quintus Fulvius
Flaccus, who, though he did not appear in the white gown,
because he was curule &aelig;dile elect, yet pressed his suit with
more warmth than any of them. The contest lay between
him and the priest of Jupiter. Fulvius at the beginning
seemed to have an equal chance with the flamen, and afterwards
surpassed him; on which, some of the plebeian tribunes
insisted that no account should be taken of him, because
one person could neither hold nor administer two offices,
especially curule ones, at the same time; while others of them
thought it proper that he ought to be exempted from the laws,
in order that the people might have the power of electing
pr&aelig;tor the person whom they wished. The consul, Lucius
Porcius, was, from the beginning, inclined to refuse admitting
him a candidate; and afterwards, wishing to have the countenance
of the senate in so doing, he called the members together,
and told them that &#8220;he desired their judgment in the
case where a curule &aelig;dile elect, without any colour of law,
and setting a precedent insufferable in a free state, stood candidate
for the pr&aelig;torship; for his part, unless they determined
otherwise, he intended to hold the election according to law.&#8221;
The senate voted, that the consul, Lucius Porcius, should recommend
to Quintus Fulvius, not to obstruct the elections for
substituting a pr&aelig;tor in the room of Caius Decimius from proceeding
according to law. When the consul, in pursuance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1836" id="Page_1836">Pg 1836</a></span>
this decree, applied to him on the subject, he answered, that
&#8220;he would do nothing unworthy of himself,&#8221; by which indeterminate
answer he left room for people to interpret his intention
agreeably to their wish, and that he meant to submit
to the direction of the senate. But, in the assembly, he urged
his pretensions with more eagerness than ever: alleging as a
charge, that the kindness of the Roman people was being
wrested from him, and an odium excited against him on account
of his suing for a second post of honour; as if it were
not manifest that, when elected pr&aelig;ter, he must instantly
abdicate the &aelig;dileship. The consul, seeing the candidate&#8217;s
obstinacy increase, and the public favour incline to him more
and more, dissolved the assembly, and summoned a meeting
of the senate; where, in a full house, they passed a vote, that
&#8220;inasmuch as the directions of the senate had produced no
effect on Flaccus, the affair concerning him should be laid
before the people.&#8221; A general assembly being summoned, when
the consul made a full representation of the matter, Fulvius,
not even then swerving from his determination, returned
thanks to the Roman people &#8220;for the great zeal which they
had shown in their desire to make him pr&aelig;tor, as often as
opportunity had been given them of declaring their sentiments;&#8221;
and assured them that &#8220;it was his resolution not to
disappoint such instances of the attachment of his countrymen.&#8221;
This determined declaration increased the ardour of
people for his cause to such a degree, that he would undoubtedly
have been chosen pr&aelig;tor, if the consul had admitted him
to stand. The tribunes maintained a violent altercation, both
with their colleagues and with the consul, until, at length, the
senate passed a decree, that &#8220;whereas the obstinacy of Quintus
Flaccus, and the ill-judged party zeal of many among the
people, had prevented the assembly for filling the place of a
pr&aelig;tor, from being held according to law. The senate therefore
gave their judgment, that the present number of pr&aelig;tors
was sufficient, that Publius Cornelius should hold both jurisdictions
in the city, and celebrate the games of Apollo.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c40" name="c40"></a>40</span>
No sooner was this election stopped by the prudence
and firmness of the senate, than another ensued, in which the
contest was still greater; since it was concerning a more important
subject, and between competitors more numerous and
more powerful. The censorship was the object of contention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1837" id="Page_1837">Pg 1837</a></span>
of the following candidates, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, Publius
Scipio, Lucius Scipio, Cneius Manlius Vulso, and Lucius Furius
Purpureo, patricians; Marcus Porcius Cato, Marcus Fulvius
Nobilior, Tiberius Sempronius Longus, Marcus Sempronius
Tuditanus, plebeians. But Marcus Porcius far surpassed all of
them, both plebeians and patricians of the highest ranks. So
great powers of mind and energy of intellect were in this man,
that no matter how lowly the position in which he was born,
he appeared capable of attaining to the highest rank. No
one qualification for the management of business, either public
or private, was wanting to him. He was equally skilled in
affairs relating to town and country. Some have been advanced
to the highest honours by their knowledge of the law,
others by their eloquence, some by military renown; but this
man&#8217;s genius was so versatile, and so well adapted to all
things, that in whatever way engaged, it might be said, that
nature formed him for that alone. In war, he was most courageous,
distinguishing himself highly in many remarkable
battles; and, when he arrived at the highest posts, was likewise
a most consummate commander. Then, in peace, if
consulted on a point of law, he was the wisest counsellor; if
a cause was to be pleaded, the most eloquent advocate. Nor
was he one of those whose oratory was striking only during
their own lives, without leaving after them any monument of
it. On the contrary, his eloquence still lives, and will long
live, consecrated to memory by writings of every kind. His
orations are many, spoken for himself, for others, and against
others; for he harassed his enemies, not only by supporting
prosecutions against them, but by maintaining causes in opposition
to them. Enmities in abundance gave him plenty of
employment, and he never permitted them to lie dormant;
nor was it easy to tell whether the nobility laboured harder to
keep him down, or he to oppress the nobility. His temper,
no doubt, was austere, his language bitter and unboundedly
free, but his mind was never conquered by his passions, his
integrity was inflexible, and he looked with contempt on popularity
and riches. In spare diet, in enduring toil and danger,
his body and mind were like iron; so that even old age, which
brings all things to dissolution, did not break his vigour. In
his eighty-sixth year he stood a trial, pleaded his own cause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1838" id="Page_1838">Pg 1838</a></span>
and published his speech; and in his ninetieth year, he brought
Servius Galba to trial, before the people.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c41" name="c41"></a>41</span>
On this occasion, when he was a candidate for censorship,
as in all his previous career, the nobility endeavoured to
crush him. All the candidates, likewise, except Lucius Flaccus,
who had been his colleague in the consulship, combined
to disappoint him of the office, not merely with a view to their
own success, in preference to him, or because they felt indignant
at the idea of seeing a man of no family censor, but because
from one who had received offence from most of them, and who
wished to retaliate, they anticipated a severe censorship, that
would endanger the reputations of many. For, even while
soliciting, he uttered frequent menaces, and upbraided them
with using their interest against him, because they dreaded
an impartial and courageous execution of the duty of censor;
at the same time, giving his interest to Lucius Valerius. He
said, that &#8220;he was the only colleague, in conjunction with whom
he could correct modern profligacy, and re-establish the ancient
morals.&#8221; People were so inflamed by such discourses, that, in
spite of the opposition made by the nobility, they not only made
Marcus Porcius censor, but gave him for his colleague Lucius
Valerius Flaccus. Immediately after the election of
censors, the consuls and pr&aelig;tors went abroad to their provinces,
except Quintus N&aelig;vius, who was detained from going
to Sardinia, for no less than four months, by inquisitions concerning
poisonings, a great part of which he held out of the
city, in the corporate towns and villages; for that method
was judged the more eligible. If we are to credit Valerius
Antias, he condemned about two thousand men, Lucius Postumius,
the pr&aelig;tor, to whose lot the province of Tarentum
had fallen, punished numerous conspiracies of the peasants,
and, with great care, finished the remainder of the inquiries
concerning the Bacchanalians. Many of these, who had not
appeared on being summoned, or had deserted their bail, were
then lurking in that part of Italy; some of them he sentenced
to punishment, and others he sent under a guard to the senate
at Rome, where they were all committed to prison by Publius
Cornelius.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c42" name="c42"></a>42</span>
In Farther Spain, the Lusitanians being weakened by
the late war, matters remained quiet. In Hither Spain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1839" id="Page_1839">Pg 1839</a></span>
Aulus Terentius took the town of Corbia, in Suessetania, by
engines and regular works, and sold the prisoners, after which
the troops had rest in their winter quarters in that province
also. The former pr&aelig;tors, Caius Calpurnius Piso and Lucius
Quintius, came home to Rome; a triumph was voted to both
by the senate with great unanimity. Caius Calpurnius triumphed
first, over the Lusitanians and Celtiberians. He carried
in procession eighty-three golden crowns, and twelve
thousand pounds&#8217; weight of silver. In a few days after, Lucius
Quintius Crispinus triumphed over the same Lusitanians
and Celtiberians, bearing in his triumph the same quantity of
gold and silver. The censors, Marcus Porcius and Lucius
Valerius, while anxious curiosity was blended with fear, made
their survey of the senate; they expelled seven from the senate,
one of them a man of consular rank, highly distinguished by
nobility of birth and honourable employments,&mdash;Lucius Quintius
Flaminius. It is mentioned, as a practice instituted in
the memory of our forefathers, that the censors should annex
marks of censure to the names of such as they degraded from
the senate. There are severe speeches of Cato, against those
whom he either expelled the senate, or degraded from the
equestrian rank, but by far the most so is that against Lucius
Quintius. Had he spoken, in the character of prosecutor,
previous to the censure, and not in that of censor after it, not
even his brother Titus, if he were his colleague, could have
suffered Quintius to remain in the senate. Among other
charges, he objected to him, that he had, by hopes of extraordinary
presents, prevailed on Philip, a Carthaginian and a
catamite, to accompany him into his province of Gaul; that this
youth, in order to enhance the merit of his complaisance to the
consul, used frequently, in wanton squabbling, to upbraid him
for having quitted Rome just before the show of gladiators.
It happened, that while they were at a feast and heated with
wine, a message was brought into the place of entertainment,
that a Boian, of high rank, had come as a deserter with his
children, and wished to see the consul, that he might, in person,
receive his assurance of protection. He was accordingly
introduced into the tent, and began to address him through an
interpreter: but while he was speaking, Quintius said to his
catamite, &#8220;Since you left the show of gladiators, have you a
mind to see this Gaul dying?&#8221; When he had assented, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1840" id="Page_1840">Pg 1840</a></span>
scarcely in earnest, the consul, drawing a sword that hung
over his head, first struck the Gaul as he was speaking, and
then, when he was running out, and imploring the protection
of the Roman people, and of those present, ran him through
the side.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c43" name="c43"></a>43</span>
Valerius Antias, as he was one who never read Cato&#8217;s
speech, and only gave credit to a tale published without authority,
tells the story in another manner, but similar to this
in lust and cruelty. He writes, that, at Placentia, the consul
invited to an entertainment a woman of ill fame, with whom
he was desperately enamoured. There, displaying his importance
to this courtesan, he told her, among other matters, with
what severity he had conducted the inquisitions, and how many
he had then in prison under sentence of death, whom he intended
to behead. Then she, being next him on the couch,
said, that having never seen an executioner perform his office,
she was very desirous of seeing such a thing; on which, the
indulgent lover ordered one of those wretches to be dragged
to the spot, and there cut off his head. The deed of death,
whether committed as the censor or as Valerius reports it, was
barbarous and inhuman; that in the midst of feasting and
cups, when it is customary to offer libations to the gods, and
to pray for happiness, a human victim should be butchered,
and the table stained with his blood, and this for the entertainment
of an acknowledged wanton. In the latter part of
Cato&#8217;s speech, he proposes to Quintius, that if he denied this
fact, and the others of which he accused him, he should give
security to abide a legal trial; but if he confessed them, could
he suppose, he asked him, that any one would be sorry for his
disgrace; the disgrace of him who, in the midst of a feast,
being intoxicated with wine and lust, had sported with the
blood of a human being.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c44" name="c44"></a>44</span>
In the review of the knights, Lucius Scipio Asiaticus was
degraded. In fixing the rates of taxation, also, the censor&#8217;s conduct
was harsh and severe to all ranks of men. People were
ordered to give account upon oath, of women&#8217;s dress, and ornaments,
and carriages exceeding in value fifteen thousand asses;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
and it was further ordered, that slaves, younger than twenty
years, which, since the last survey, had been sold for ten thousand
asses<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> or more, should be estimated at ten times their value;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1841" id="Page_1841">Pg 1841</a></span>and that, on all these articles, a tax should be laid of three
denariuses<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> for each thousand asses.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The censors took away
water which belonged to the public running or carried into
any private building or field; and they demolished within
thirty days all buildings or sheds, in possession of private
persons, that projected into public ground. They then engaged
contractors for executing national works, with the
money decreed for that purpose,&mdash;for paving cisterns with
stone, for cleansing the sewers where it was requisite, and
forming new ones on the Aventine, and in other quarters
where hitherto there had been none. Then, dividing their
tasks, Flaccus built a mole at Nepthunia, on the coast, and
made a road through the Formian mountains. Cato purchased
for the use of the people two halls, the M&aelig;nian and
Titian, in the Lautumi&aelig;, and four shops, and built there a
court of justice, which was called the Porcian. They farmed
out the several branches of the revenue at the highest prices,
and bargained with the contractors for the performance of the
public services on the lowest terms. When the senate,
overcome by the prayers and lamentations of the publicans,
ordered those bargains to be revoked, and new agreements to
be made; the censors, by an edict, excluded from competition
the persons who had eluded the former contracts, and farmed
out all the same branches at prices very little reduced. This
was a remarkable censorship, and the origin of many deadly
feuds: it rendered Marcus Porcius, to whom all the harshness
was attributed, uneasy during the remainder of his
life. This year, two colonies were established, Potentia in
Picenum, and Pisaurum in the Gallic territory. Six acres
were given to each settler. The same commissioners had the
ordering of both colonies, and the division of the lands, Quintus
Fabius Labeo, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, and Quintus Fulvius
Nobilior. The consuls of that year performed nothing memorable
at home or abroad.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c45" name="c45"></a>45</span>
They elected to serve as consuls for the ensuing year,
Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Quintus Fabius Labeo.
These, on the ides of March, the first day of their assuming
the administration, proposed to the senate to determine their
provinces, and those of the pr&aelig;tors. The pr&aelig;tors appointed
were, Caius Valerius, flamen of Jupiter, who had been candidate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1842" id="Page_1842">Pg 1842</a></span>
the year before, Spurius Posthumius Albinus, Publius
Cornelius Sisenna, Lucius Pupius, Lucius Julius, and Cneius
Sicinius. Liguria was ordered to be the province of the consuls,
and the armies were assigned to them, which Publius
Claudius and Marcus Porcius had commanded. The two
Spains, without being put to the lot, were reserved for the
pr&aelig;tors who held them the year before, and also their own
armies. The pr&aelig;tors were ordered to regulate their casting
lots, in such a manner, that the flamen of Jupiter should have
one or other of the judicial employments at Rome. The
foreign jurisdiction fell to his lot, that between citizens to
Cornelius Sisenna. Sicily was assigned to Spurius Posthumius,
Apulia to Lucius Pupius, Gaul to Lucius Julius, Sardinia
to Cneius Sicinius. Lucius Julius was ordered to hasten
to his province, because some transalpine Gauls, as was mentioned
before, having made their way through the forests into
Italy, by an unknown road, were building a town in the country
which now forms the district of Aquileia. Orders were given
to the pr&aelig;tor to prevent their doing so, as far as might lie in his
power without appealing to arms; and, if it should be necessary
to stop them by force, to give information to the consuls,
one of whom was, in that case, directed to march his legions
against those Gauls. Towards the close of the preceding
year, an assembly had been held for the purpose of electing an
augur, in the room of Cneius Cornelius deceased, when
Spurius Posthumius Albinus was chosen.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c46" name="c46"></a>46</span>
In the beginning of this year, Publius Licinius Crassus,
chief pontiff, died, in whose room was appointed Marcus
Sempronius Tuditanus, and Caius Servilius Geminus was
raised to the place of chief pontiff. On occasion of the funeral
of Publius Licinius a largess of flesh was distributed to the
people, and one hundred and twenty pair of gladiators fought.
The funeral games lasted three days; and, after the games, a
public feast was given. During the feast, and while the
couches were spread over the forum, a storm came on with
violent gusts of wind, and compelled most of the people to
pitch tents in that place. The same, on the weather clearing
up, in a short time after, were removed. It was rumoured
about, that they had fulfilled a prophecy which soothsayers
had pronounced, among the decrees of the fates, that, inevitably,
tents would be pitched in the forum. As soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1843" id="Page_1843">Pg 1843</a></span>
they were relieved from those religious fears, they were struck
with new ones, by showers of blood falling for two days, in
the area of Vulcan&#8217;s temple, and a supplication was ordered
by the decemvirs for the sake of expiating the prodigy. Before
the consuls set out for their provinces, they introduced
the embassies from the countries beyond the sea to an audience
of the senate; and at no time was there in Rome such a
number of people from those regions. For, as soon as a report
spread through the nations which border on Macedon,
that accusations and complaints against Philip were listened to
by the Romans with some degree of attention, and that it had
been of advantage to many to complain;&mdash;all these states and
nations, and even individuals, on their own accounts, (for he
was a troublesome neighbour to every one,) flocked to Rome,
with hopes of obtaining either redress of their injuries, or, at
least, the consolation of expressing their griefs. An embassy
came also from king Eumenes, with his brother Athen&aelig;us, to
complain of the garrisons not being withdrawn by Philip out
of Thrace; and, likewise, of his sending succours into Bithynia,
to Prusias, who was at war with Eumenes.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c47" name="c47"></a>47</span>
Demetrius, who was then very young, had to answer
all these representations; and it was no easy matter to retain
in memory, either all the charges which were brought against
his father, or what was proper to be said in reply. For the
charges were not only numerous, but most of them exceedingly
frivolous; of disputes about boundaries, of men forced
away and cattle driven off; of justice, either capriciously administered
or refused; of property adjudged either by force
or influence. When the senate perceived that Demetrius
could not explain any of those matters distinctly, and that
they could not gain satisfactory information from him, and
when, at the same time, the youth, through inexperience and
bashfulness, was much embarrassed, they ordered that he
should be asked whether he had received from his father any
written instructions on those points; and on his answering
that he had, it appeared to them better and more proper to
receive the answers of the king himself, on each particular
head; so they immediately called for the scroll, but afterwards
gave him leave to read it to them in person. Here
were his apologies on each subject, compressed into a narrow
compass; informing them that, in some cases, he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1844" id="Page_1844">Pg 1844</a></span>
acted in conformity to the determinations of the ambassadors;
in others, that the fault of not conforming to them, lay not in
him, but actually in the persons themselves who accused him.
He had interspersed, also, complaints concerning the injustice
of the decrees, and the partiality with which the discussion
was carried on in presence of C&aelig;cilius, and of the insults that
were offered him, in a most unworthy and unmerited manner
by all. The senate inferred from these marks that his mind
was irritated; nevertheless, on the young man apologizing for
some things, and undertaking that others should be performed
in the manner most agreeable to the senate, they ordered the
answer to be given him, that &#8220;in no instance had his father
acted with more propriety, or given more pleasure to the
senate, than in his choosing, whatever the nature of those
transactions might be, to send his excuses for them to the
Romans, by his son Demetrius. That the senate could leave
unnoticed, forget, and put up with, many past matters, and
believe also that they might place confidence in Demetrius;
for though they restored his person to his father, they still had
his mind as a hostage, and were convinced that, as far as he
could, without infringing on his duty to his father, he was a
friend to the Roman people. That, to do him honour, they
would send ambassadors into Macedon, in order that, if any
thing which ought to have been done was left undone, it
might then be effected, but still without requiring an atonement
for former omissions. That they wished Philip also to
be sensible, that it was owing to the kind offices of his son
Demetrius, that the treaty between him and the Roman people
remained inviolate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c48" name="c48"></a>48</span>
These declarations, which were made with the intention
of adding to the dignity of his character, proved to the
young man the cause of immediate envy, and of not far distant
ruin. The Laced&aelig;monians were next introduced, when
many insignificant disputes were agitated. Those which
might be deemed important were&mdash;whether the persons whom
the Ach&aelig;ans had condemned, should be reinstated or not;
whether they slew with justice or the reverse those whom
they put to death; the question was debated also whether the
Laced&aelig;monians should continue in the Ach&aelig;ans&#8217; council, or,
as had formerly been the case, that single state in Peloponnesus
should have separate independence. It was determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1845" id="Page_1845">Pg 1845</a></span>
&Ograve;that the condemned should be reinstated, and the sentences
passed reversed; that Laced&aelig;mon should continue in the
Ach&aelig;an council, and that this decree should be committed to
writing, and signed by the Laced&aelig;monians and Ach&aelig;ans.
Quintus Marcius was sent ambassador into Macedon, with
orders, likewise, to take a view of the affairs of the allies in
Peloponnesus; for there also disturbances still subsisted, in
consequence of the old quarrels, and Messene had revolted
from the Ach&aelig;an confederacy. But if I were to trace out the
cause and progress of this war, I should deviate from the resolution
by which I determined not to treat of foreign events,
further than they are connected with the affairs of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c49" name="c49"></a>49</span>
One event deserves to be mentioned: that, notwithstanding
the Ach&aelig;ans had a superiority in the war, Philop&#339;men,
their pr&aelig;tor, was taken prisoner on his march to secure
Corone, which the enemy meant to attack, being, with a small
party of horse, surprised in a dangerous defile. It is said that
he might have effected his own escape, by the aid of some
Thracians and Cretans who were with him, but the shame of
deserting his horsemen, the most distinguished youths in the
nation, selected by himself a short time before, detained him
there. Whilst he is procuring for these an opportunity of
getting clear of the narrow defile, by closing the rear in person,
and sustaining the assaults of the enemy, his horse fell.
By the shock of his fall, and the weight of the horse, which
fell upon him, he was very nearly killed on the spot; for he
was now seventy years old, and his strength had been greatly
impaired by a tedious illness, from which he was but just recovered.
Lying thus on the ground, the enemy pouring on,
secured him. Out of respect to his character, however, and
from regard to his merit, they raised him up, when they recognised
him, with as much care as if he had been their own
commander, and revived him, and carried him out of that
remote valley into the road, and they scarcely believed their
own senses, on account of the unexpected joy; however, some
of them sent on messages to Messene, that the war was at an
end, for they were bringing Philop&#339;men prisoner. At first
it seemed so incredible, that the messenger was deemed either
a liar or a madman. Afterwards, when numbers came, one
after another, all asserting the same, credence was at length
given to the matter; and, before they well knew whether he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1846" id="Page_1846">Pg 1846</a></span>
was come near the city, all, freemen and slaves, with even
women and children, poured out to enjoy the sight; insomuch
that the multitude quite closed up the gate, whilst each person
seemed unlikely to consider the thing as certain unless he
should obtain certain belief by his own eye-sight. Those
who conducted Philop&#339;men, with difficulty removing those
in their way, were able to enter the gate, but the dense crowd
completely blocked up the street; and, as the greatest part of
these were excluded from the sight, they suddenly filled a
theatre which was contiguous to the street, and all with one
voice insisted that he should be brought thither for the public
view. The magistrates and leading men, fearing that compassion
for so great a man, on seeing him, would cause some
disturbance; as many would be moved by respect for his
former dignity, when they compared it with his present condition,
and many by the recollection of his transcendent
merits, placed him where he could be seen at a distance.
And quickly after hurried him away out of the sight of the
people, who were told by the pr&aelig;tor, Dinocrates, that there
were some subjects intimately connected with the decision of
the war, on which the magistrates wished to interrogate him.
Having carried him thence to the senate-house, and called
the council together, they began a consultation on the measures
to be pursued.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c50" name="c50"></a>50</span>
The evening came on while they were still at a loss,
not only about other matters, but even about the place where
he might be kept with proper security during the following
night. They were quite confounded at the greatness of his
former fortune and merit; and they neither dared to undertake
the guarding of him at their houses, nor thought it safe
to trust the custody of him to any individual. At last some
persons reminded them of a public treasury under ground,
enclosed with hewn stone; into this place he was put down,
in chains, and a huge stone, with which it is generally covered,
was placed over it, with the help of a machine. After having
thus determined to trust to the place, rather than to any man,
for his safe keeping, they waited with impatience for the dawn.
On the following day, the whole populace, mindful of his
former services to the state, declared their opinion, that they
ought to spare him, and to seek through his means some remedies
for their present misfortunes. But the authors of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1847" id="Page_1847">Pg 1847</a></span>
revolt, in whose hands was the management of affairs, consulting
in secret, unanimously resolved to put him to death;
but whether they should do it speedily, or defer it, was for
some time a matter of doubt. The party that were more
eager for his immediate execution, at length prevailed, and a
person was sent to him with poison. They relate, that on
receiving the cup, he only asked if Lycortas, the other commander
of the Ach&aelig;ans, and the horsemen had escaped; and
being told that they were safe, he said, &#8220;It is well,&#8221; and then
intrepidly drinking the contents of the cup, expired shortly
after. The actors of this piece of cruelty, however, did not
long rejoice at his death; for Messene being conquered in
war, delivered up the guilty individuals to the Ach&aelig;ans, when
they positively demanded them. The bones of Philop&#339;men
were restored, and his funeral was attended by the whole
Ach&aelig;an council, every human honour being heaped on him
to such a degree, that they did not withhold divine ones. So
much is conceded to this man by historians, both Greek and
Latin, that several of them have recorded, as a circumstance
remarkably distinguishing this year, that three illustrious
commanders died in it, Philop&#339;men, Hannibal, and Publius
Scipio. To such an extent have they placed him on an equal
footing with the most consummate generals of the two most
powerful nations.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c51" name="c51"></a>51</span>
Titus Quintius Flamininus came ambassador to king
Prusias, who had incurred the jealousy of the Romans, by
entertaining Hannibal after the flight of Antiochus, and by
making war on Eumenes. At the court of Prusias, either
because, among other discourse, he reproached him with his
giving protection to a person, who, of all men living, was
the most inveterate enemy to the Roman nation, who had incited,
first his own country, and afterwards, when its power
was reduced, king Antiochus, to make war on Rome; or because
Prusias himself, with the design of gratifying Flamininus
and the Roman people, conceived the design of killing
Hannibal, or delivering him into their hands; immediately
after the first conference with Flamininus, a party of soldiers
was sent to guard Hannibal&#8217;s house. The Carthaginian had
always foreseen some such end of his life; for he knew the
implacable hatred which the Romans bore him, and placed
little confidence in the faith of kings. Besides, he had experienced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1848" id="Page_1848">Pg 1848</a></span>
the fickle temper of Prusias, and had, for some
time, dreaded the arrival of Flamininus, as an event fatal to
him. Encircled by enemies on every side, in order to have
always some path open for flight, he had made seven passages
from his house, of which some were concealed, lest they
might be invested by a guard. But the imperious government
of kings suffers nothing to remain secret which they choose
to discover. They surrounded the circuit of the entire house
with guards in such a manner, that no one could escape from
it. Hannibal, on being told that some of the king&#8217;s soldiers
were in the porch, endeavoured to escape through a back
door, which was the most private, and from which the passage
was most secret; but, perceiving that to be guarded by
a body of soldiers, and every avenue round to be blocked up
by the guards that were posted, he called for poison, which
he had long kept in readiness to meet such an event, and
said, &#8220;Let us release the Romans from their long anxiety,
since they think it too long to wait for the death of an old
man. Flamininus will gain no very great or memorable victory
over one unarmed and betrayed. What an alteration has
taken place in the behaviour of the Roman people, this day
affords abundant proof. Their fathers gave warning to
Pyrrhus, their armed foe, then heading an army against them
in Italy, to beware of poison. The present generation have
sent an ambassador, of consular rank, to persuade Prusias
villanously to murder his guest.&#8221; Then imprecating curses
on the head of Prusias, and on his kingdom, and calling on
the gods who presided over hospitality, and were witnesses
of his breach of faith, he drank off the contents of the cup.
This was the end of the life of Hannibal.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c52" name="c52"></a>52</span>
Both Polybius and Rutilius say, that Scipio died in
this year; but I do not agree either with them, or Valerius.
Not with them, because I find that in the censorship of Marcus
Porcius and Lucius Valerius, the censor himself, Lucius
Valerius, was chosen prince of the senate, although Africanus
had occupied that place for the three preceding lustrums; and,
if he were alive, unless he had been displaced from the senate,
which disgrace no one has recorded, another prince would not
have been chosen in his room. The authority of Antias is
refuted by the plebeian tribunate of Marcus N&aelig;vius, against
whom there is extant a speech signed by Publius Africanus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1849" id="Page_1849">Pg 1849</a></span>
Now, this Marcus N&aelig;vius, in the register of the magistrates,
appears to have been plebeian tribune in the consulate of
Publius Claudius and Lucius Porcius; but he entered on the
tribuneship in the consulate of Appius Claudius and Marcus
Sempronius, on the fourth day before the ides of December,
from which time to the ides of March, when Publius Claudius
and Lucius Porcius became consuls, there are three months.
Thus it appears that he was living in the tribunate of Marcus
N&aelig;vius, and might have been prosecuted by him; but that
he died before the censorship of Lucius Valerius and Marcus
Porcius. The deaths of the three most illustrious men of
their respective nations have a similarity, not only in respect
to the concurrence of the times, but in this circumstance also,
that no one of them met a death suitable to the splendour of
his life. In the first place, neither of them died or was
buried in his native soil. Hannibal and Philop&#339;men were
taken off by poison; Hannibal breathed his last in exile,
betrayed by his host; Philop&#339;men in captivity, in a prison,
and in chains. Scipio, though neither banished nor condemned,
yet under prosecution, and summoned as an absent
criminal to a trial, at which he did not appear, passed sentence
of voluntary exile, not only on himself while alive, but
likewise on his body after death.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c53" name="c53"></a>53</span>
During these transactions in Peloponnesus, from which
my narration digressed, the return of Demetrius with the
ambassadors into Macedonia, affected people&#8217;s minds in various
manners. The generality of the Macedonians, whom the
apprehension of an impending war with the Romans had
struck with terror, looked with the highest esteem on Demetrius,
as the promoter of peace; and, at the same time, with
confident hope, destined for him the throne, after the demise
of his father. They argued, that &#8220;although he was younger
than Perseus, yet he was born of a wife, and the other of a
concubine; that the latter, born of a mother who prostituted
her person, had no likeness to any particular father, whereas
the former had a striking resemblance of Philip. Besides it
was probable that the Romans would place him on the throne
of his father, as Perseus had no pretensions to their favour.&#8221;
Such was the conversation of people, in general. Fear tortured
Perseus, lest his age alone might not sufficiently secure
his interest, his brother having the advantage of him in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1850" id="Page_1850">Pg 1850</a></span>
other particular; while Philip himself, believing that it would
scarcely rest with his decision which of them he should leave
heir to his dominions, began to think that his younger son
encroached on him more than he could wish. He was sometimes
displeased at the numerous attendance of the Macedonians
round Demetrius, and chagrined at perceiving that there
was a second court during his own life-time. The young
prince no doubt came home much elevated in his own estimation,
elated with the honours paid him by the senate, and
their having conceded to him, what they had refused to his
father; insomuch that every mention of the Romans, whatever
degree of respect it procured him from the rest of the
Macedonians, created an equal degree of envy, not only in the
breast of his brother, but also in that of his father; especially
after the Roman ambassadors arrived, and the king was
obliged to evacuate Thrace, to withdraw his garrisons, and to
perform the other articles, either according to the decisions of
the former ambassadors or the late regulations made by the
senate. But all this he did with great reluctance, and even
with anguish of mind, the more on this account, because he
saw his son more frequently in company with them than with
himself; nevertheless, to avoid giving any pretence for an
immediate commencement of hostilities, he acted submissively
towards the Romans. Thinking it necessary to turn away
their thoughts from a suspicion of any such designs, he led an
army into the heart of Thrace, against the Odrysians, Dantheletians,
and Bessians. He took the city of Philoppopolis,
after it was deserted by the inhabitants, who fled with their
families to the tops of the nearest mountains; and, by wasting
the country, reduced the barbarians living in the plains to
submission. Then leaving a garrison in Philoppopolis, which,
was soon after expelled by the Odrysians, he began to build a
town in Deuriopus. This is a district of P&aelig;onia, near the
river Erigonus, which, flowing from Illyricum through P&aelig;onia,
falls into the river Axius. Not far from the old city of
Stob&aelig; he built his new one, which he ordered to be called
Perseis, that this honour might be conferred on his eldest son.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c54" name="c54"></a>54</span>
While these things passed in Macedonia, the consuls
went to their provinces. Marcellus sent forward an express
to Lucius Porcius, the proconsul, to lead up the legions to the
new town of the Gauls; they surrendered themselves to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1851" id="Page_1851">Pg 1851</a></span>
consul on his arrival. There were of these twelve thousand
fighting men, most of whom had arms, which they had forced
from the inhabitants: all which, to their great mortification,
were taken from them, as was every thing else which they
had either acquired by plundering in the country, or had
brought along with them. They sent ambassadors to Rome
to complain of those proceedings, who being introduced to an
audience of the senate, by the pr&aelig;tor Caius Valerius, represented
that &#8220;in consequence of a redundancy of people in
Gaul they had been compelled by the want of land, and
indeed of every thing, to cross the Alps in quest of a settlement:
that they had settled in those lands which they found
waste and uncultivated without doing injury to any. They
had likewise begun to build a town, which was a proof that
they did not come to ravage either city or lands. That some
time ago, Marcus Claudius sent them a message, that unless
they surrendered to him he would march against them, and
that preferring a certain, though not very honourable peace,
to the uncertainties of war, they had thrown themselves on
the protection of Rome before they submitted to its power.
That in a short time after, being ordered to quit the country,
they had intended to remove without murmuring to whatever
part of the world they were able; and that, notwithstanding,
their arms, and finally all the property which they had
brought with them, or driven before them, were taken from
them. They therefore besought the senate and people of
Rome not to treat harmless people, who had surrendered
themselves, with greater severity than they would enemies.&#8221;
To this discourse the senate ordered the following answer to
be given: That &#8220;neither had they acted properly in coming
into Italy, and attempting to build a town in the territory of
others, without permission from any Roman magistrate commanding
in that province; nor did the senate approve of
people who had surrendered being stripped of their property.
They would therefore send to the consuls ambassadors, who
would order all their effects to be restored, provided they
returned to the place whence they came; and who would
also proceed to the other side of the Alps, and give warning
to the Gallic states to keep their people at home. That the
Alps, an almost impassable barrier, lay between the two
countries, and whoever should pass in future, should meet no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1852" id="Page_1852">Pg 1852</a></span>
better fate than those who first proved them to be passable.&#8221;
The ambassadors sent were Lucius Furius Purpureo, Quintus
Minucius, Publius Manlius Acidinus. The Gauls, on the
restoration of such property as they were in possession of,
without wronging any man, withdrew out of Italy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c55" name="c55"></a>55</span>
The transalpine states answered the Roman ambassadors
in terms of kindness. Their elders even found fault
with the excessive lenity of the Roman people, in &#8220;suffering
men to depart with impunity, who, without an order of their
nation, left their home, attempted to seize on lands belonging
to the Roman empire, and to build a town in a territory
which belonged to others. They ought,&#8221; they said, &#8220;to have
paid a heavy penalty for their inconsiderate conduct; and as
to the restoration of their effects, they expressed a fear, lest,
in consequence of this too great forbearance, others might be
encouraged to attempts of a like nature.&#8221; They not only
entertained the ambassadors, but conferred considerable presents
on them. The consul, Marcus Claudius, when he had
sent the Gauls out of his province, began to prepare for a war
with the Istrians, and wrote to the senate for permission to
lead the legions into their country. That measure pleased
the senate. They formed an intention of establishing a colony
at Aquileia; nor were they able to decide whether it should
consist of Latins or Roman citizens; at last however they
passed a vote in favour of a Latin settlement. The commissioners
appointed for the purpose were, Publius Scipio
Nasica, Caius Flaminius, and Lucius Manlius Acidinus. In
the same year, colonies of Roman citizens were led out to
Mutina and Parma. Two thousand men were settled in each
colony, on lands which lately belonged to the Boians, and formerly
to the Tuscans; they received at Parma eight acres, at
Mutina five each. These colonists were conducted by Marcus
&AElig;milius Lepidus, Titus &AElig;butius Carus, and Lucius Quintius
Crispinus. The colony of Saturnia, also consisting of Roman
citizens, was settled on the lands of Caletra, by Quintus
Fabius Labeo, Caius Afranius Stellio, and Tiberius Sempronius
Gracchus. Ten acres were assigned to each man.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="c56" name="c56"></a>56</span>
In the same year Aulus Terentius Varro, the propr&aelig;tor,
fought some successful battles with the Celtiberians, not far
from the river Iberus, in the territory of Auseta, reducing
several towns, which they had fortified in that quarter. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1853" id="Page_1853">Pg 1853</a></span>
Farther Spain was quiet during the whole year, because Publius
Sempronius, the propr&aelig;tor, was seized with a lingering
disorder, and the Lusitanians, when no one attacked them,
very opportunely kept quiet. In Liguria nothing extraordinary
was performed by Quintus Fabius, the consul. Marcus
Marcellus being recalled out of Istria to attend the elections,
disbanded his army, and came home to Rome. He elected
Cneius B&aelig;bius Tamphilus and Lucius &AElig;milius Paulus
consuls. This latter had been curule &aelig;dile, along with Marcus
&AElig;milius Lepidus, from the time of whose consulate this
was the fifth year; and this very Lepidus had been made
consul after two repulses. Then Quintus Fulvius Flaccus,
Marcus Valerius L&aelig;vinus, Publius Manlius a second time,
Marcus Ogulnius Gallus, Lucius C&aelig;cilius Denter, and
Caius Terentius Istra, were elected pr&aelig;tors. Towards the
close of the year, a supplication was performed on occasion of
prodigies, for people were persuaded that it had rained blood
for two days in the court of the temple of Concord; and an
account was received, that near the coast of Sicily a new
island, which had never been there before, rose out of the sea.
Valerius, of Antium, asserts that Hannibal died in this year,
and that besides Titus Quintius Flamininus, whose name was
celebrated in this business, Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, and Publius
Scipio Nasica, were sent ambassadors to Prusias on that
occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="bk40" id="bk40"></a>BOOK XL</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>When Philip had ordered the children of those whom he had put to death,
to be sought after as hostages, Theoxena, fearing the king&#8217;s passion for
her own children and those of her sister, who were still quite young,
brought forward swords and a cup in which there was poison, and
persuaded them to escape, by putting an end to their existence, the
mockery that awaited them; after administering which advice, she in
company with her husband plunged headlong from the ship into the sea.
The quarrels between Perseus and Demetrius, the sons of Philip, king
of Macedon, are related; and how that Demetrius was first assailed by
accusations invented through his brother&#8217;s guile, and among the rest, an
impeachment for parricide and aspiring to the throne, and at last, since
he was the friend of the Roman people, cut off by poison; and the kingdom
of Macedon, on the death of Philip, fell to Perseus. It contains
likewise the exploits successfully achieved by very many commanders in
Liguria, and against the Celtiberians in Spain. Under the Janiculum,
in the field of L. Petillius, the secretary, the books of Numa Pompilius
were found by the labourers of the field, enclosed in a stone chest, written
in both Latin and Greek characters; in which, when the pr&aelig;tor, to
whom they had been brought, had read very many things calculated to
overthrow the present system of religion, he swore to the senate that their
being read and preserved would be detrimental to the state. And by a
decree of the senate they were burned in the Comitium. The colony of
Aquilia was planted. Philip, worn out by the pangs of conscience,
because, influenced by the false information of his other son Perseus, he
had by poison removed from life&#8217;s scene his son Demetrius, both
resolved on the punishment of Perseus and desired to leave his friend
Antigonus, rather than him, as his successor. But, whilst forming this
project, he was hurried off by death. Perseus received the kingdom.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d1" name="d1"></a>1</span>
At the commencement of the next year, the consuls and
pr&aelig;tors determined the provinces by lot. For the consuls
there was no province to be decreed, except Liguria. The
city jurisdiction fell to Marcus Ogulnius Gallus; that among
foreigners, to Marcus Valerius; of the Spains, the Hither, to
Marcus Fulvius Flaccus; the Farther, to Publius Manlius;
Sicily, to Lucius Ctecilius Denter; and Sardinia, to Caius
Terentius Istra. The consuls were ordered to hold levies, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1855" id="Page_1855">Pg 1855</a></span>
Quintus Fabius had written from Liguria, that the Apuani
seemed inclined to a renewal of hostilities, and that it was to
be feared that they would make an irruption into the district
of Pis&aelig;. From the Spains, also, they received intelligence
that the Hither province was in arms; that the war still continued
with the Celtiberians: that, in the Farther province,
because the pr&aelig;tor had been for a long time indisposed,
military discipline was relaxed by intemperance and inactivity.
For these reasons it was decreed that new armies should be
raised; four legions for Liguria, that each might contain five
thousand two hundred foot, and three hundred horse, and to
these same were added, fifteen thousand foot and eight hundred
horse of the Latin allies. These were to complete the
two consular armies. They were ordered, also, to enrol seven
thousand foot and four hundred horse, of the allies and
Latins, and to send them into Gaul to Marcus Marcellus,
whose command was prolonged on the expiration of his consulship.
There were ordered to be levied, of Roman citizens,
four thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry, and of the
allies, seven thousand infantry with three hundred cavalry,
which should be also led into both Spains. And to Quintus
Fabius Labeo, with the army which he had in Liguria, was
the command prolonged for a year.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d2" name="d2"></a>2</span>
The spring of this year was remarkable for storms. On
the day before the feast of Pales, a tremendous hurricane
arose about mid-day, and made havoc in many places, both
sacred and common. It threw down the brazen statues in the
Capitol; tore away a gate from the temple of Luna, which is
on the Aventine, and fastened it to the back parts of the
temple of Ceres; overturned other statues in the Circus
Maximus, together with the pillars on which they stood; tore
off several cupolas from the roofs of temples, and scattered
them in an unseemly manner. This storm was converted into
a prodigy, and the aruspices ordered it to be attended to. At
the same time expiation was made, because it had been
reported that a three-footed mule was born at Reate, and that
the temple of Apollo, at Formi&aelig; and at Caieta, was struck
with lightning. On account of these prodigies, a sacrifice of
twenty larger victims was offered, and there was a supplication
of one day&#8217;s continuance. About the same time information
was obtained from a letter of Aulus Terentius, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1856" id="Page_1856">Pg 1856</a></span>
propr&aelig;tor, that Publius Sempronius, after being sick for more
than a year, had died in the Farther province: on this account
the pr&aelig;tors were ordered to set out sooner for Spain. The
foreign embassies were then brought before the senate; and
first, those of the kings Eumenes and Pharnaces, and of the
Rhodians, complaining of the sufferings of the inhabitants of
Sinope. There came also, about the same time, the ambassadors
of Philip, the Ach&aelig;ans, and Laced&aelig;monians. Answers
were given to these, after Marcius, who had been sent to
inspect the affairs of Greece and Macedonia, had first received
an audience. To the Asiatic kings and the Rhodians, they
answered, that the senate would send ambassadors to examine
into those matters.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d3" name="d3"></a>3</span>
Marcius had increased their anxiety respecting Philip;
for, he acknowledged that the latter had acquiesced with the
will of the senate in such a manner, as to render it very
evident, that he would conform to it no longer than necessity
obliged him; nor was it difficult to see, that he intended to
renew hostilities, and that every thing which he then said and
did had a tendency that way. Now, in the first place, he removed
almost the whole body of the citizens, with their
families, from the maritime cities, into Emathia, which is its
modern name, it was formerly called P&aelig;onia; he gave up those
cities to be inhabited by Thracians, and other barbarians,
thinking that this kind of people would prove more faithful to
him in case of a war with Rome. This proceeding caused
great discontent over all Macedonia; and of those who, with
their wives and children, left their dwellings, few concealed
their grief in silence; and, their hatred overcoming their fear,
imprecations against the king were heard, as they proceeded
along in groups. His mind, rendered savage by these things,
entertained suspicions of all men, places, and seasons; at last
he began to confess openly, that he had nothing sufficiently
safe without seizing and confining the sons of those whom he
had destroyed, and sending them out of the world at different
times.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d4" name="d4"></a>4</span>
This cruelty, horrible in itself, the calamities of one particular
family rendered still more so. Philip had, many years
before, put to death Herodicus, a Thessalian of distinction;
and afterwards his sons-in-law. His daughters were left
widows, having each a little son. The names of the women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1857" id="Page_1857">Pg 1857</a></span>
were Theoxena and Archo. Theoxena, though courted by
many, rejected every offer of marriage. Archo married a
certain Poris, by far the first of the &AElig;nean nation; and, after
bearing him many children, died, leaving them all quite
young. Theoxena then, in order that her sister&#8217;s children
might be educated under her own inspection, married Poris,
and as if she herself had borne them all, treated her own and
her sister&#8217;s sons with the same affectionate care. When she
heard of the king&#8217;s order for seizing the children of the persons
who had been put to death, supposing that they were
destined to afford sport not only to the king&#8217;s lust, but to that
of his guards, she formed in her mind a horrid project, and
had the hardiness to declare, that she would kill them all with
her own hand, rather than they should come into the power of
Philip. Poris, abhorring the mention of such a dreadful
deed, told her that he would carry them away to Athens, to
some faithful friends, and would himself accompany them in
their flight. They all went from Thessalonica to &AElig;nea, to
a stated sacrifice, which they offer yearly, with great solemnity,
in honour of &AElig;neas, the founder of the nation. Having
spent the day there, in the anniversary feast, about the third
watch, when all were asleep, they embarked in a vessel ready
prepared by Poris, as if intending to return to Thessalonica;
but their design was to cross over to Eub&#339;a. However, daylight
surprised them at a small distance from the land,
struggling in vain against a contrary wind, and the king&#8217;s
officers, who commanded the garrison of the port, despatched
an armed bark to bring back their ship, with a strict injunction
not to return without it. When they were now
drawing nigh, Poris was intently occupied in animating the
rowers and sailors, and, at times, raising his hands towards
heaven, supplicated the gods to assist him. Meanwhile, the
woman, with desperate fury recurring to the shocking design
which she had long premeditated, dissolves some poison, and
produces swords; then, placing the cup in their view, and unsheathing
the swords, she says, &#8220;Death is our only refuge.
These paths lead thither, by whichever of them each one&#8217;s inclination
leads them to adopt, let them escape the tyranny of
the king. Come then, dear youths, let those of you who are
the elder, first take the sword; or, if a slower death is your
choice, drain the cup.&#8221; At the same time the enemy was fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1858" id="Page_1858">Pg 1858</a></span>
approaching, and she, who urged them to despatch themselves,
was urgent; the young men, having put an end to their lives
some by the one and some by the other fatal expedient, were
thrown expiring into the sea. Then, embracing her husband
and companion in death, she plunged into the deep. The
king&#8217;s officers then took possession of the ship, deserted by its
owners.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d5" name="d5"></a>5</span>
The barbarity connected with this deed added fresh fuel
to the flame of public resentment kindled against the king, insomuch
that most people uttered imprecations on himself and
his children; which curses being in a short time heard by all
the gods, caused him to vent his cruelty on his own blood relations.
For Perseus, when he perceived that the popularity
and high reputation of his brother Demetrius among the
Macedonian people, and interest among the Romans, increased
more and more every day, and that no hope was left him of
obtaining the crown save by the instrumentality of some
wicked device, bent all his thoughts to that one object.
But not thinking himself alone strong enough even for the
dastardly project, which he meditated in his effeminate mind,
he began to tamper with each of his father&#8217;s friends by dark
suggestions. At first, several of these showed an appearance
of rejecting with scorn any such overtures, because they entertained
higher expectations from Demetrius. Afterwards
Philip&#8217;s animosity to the Romans increased every day, which
Perseus fomented; but Demetrius, with all his might, opposed.
Foreseeing the fatal doom of the youth, who heeded
not a brother&#8217;s guile, and thinking that they must lend their
assistance to the accomplishment of what was likely to take
place, and cherish the hopes of the more powerful, they united
themselves to Perseus. They defer the execution of other
measures till their proper season; for the present, it seems
good that the king should by every strenuous exertion be inflamed
against the Romans, and urged to form resolutions
for war, to which he had already of his own accord turned his
attention. At the same time, in order that Demetrius might
be a greater object of suspicion every day, they used deliberately
to prolong the conversations even to the use of insulting
language towards the Romans; thereupon, when some depreciating
their manners and institutions, some their military
achievements, some the appearance of the city itself, unadorned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1859" id="Page_1859">Pg 1859</a></span>
either by public or private structures; others spoke scornfully
of some particular individuals among their principal men.
On these occasions, the young prince unwary, both out of
affection for the Roman nation, and opposition to his brother,
by maintaining their cause in all things, rendered himself
an object of suspicion to his father, and a fit subject for their
accusations. His father therefore kept him a stranger to all
his designs respecting the Romans; he was entirely devoted
to Perseus, and held with him, daily and nightly, deliberations
on that subject. The envoys had returned whom he
happened to have sent to the Bastarnians, to solicit aid, and
brought with them from thence young men of distinction, and
some of royal extraction; one of whom promised his sister in
marriage to Philip&#8217;s son, and the connexion with that nation
raised the king&#8217;s spirits. Hereupon Perseus said, &#8220;What
does that avail? There is by no means as much protection
afforded by foreign aid, as there is danger arising from domestic
treachery. I am unwilling to call him traitor, but a
spy we certainly have in our bosom, and although the Romans
have restored to us his body, since he was a hostage at Rome,
yet they still possess his heart. The faces of almost all the
Macedonians are turned towards him, and they think they are
to have no other king but him whom the Romans would give
them.&#8221; By such discourses the old man&#8217;s mind, distempered
in itself, was stimulated to passion, and these imputations he
received deeper in his mind, than appeared from his countenance.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d6" name="d6"></a>6</span>
It happened to be the time of the purification of the
army; which ceremony is thus performed:&mdash;The head and
fore part of a dog cut through the middle is laid at the
right side of the way, and the hinder part with the entrails
at the left. Between the parts of the victim, thus divided,
the forces are led under arms. In the front of the van, are
carried the remarkable suits of armour of all the kings of
Macedon, from the remotest origin; next follows the king
himself, with his children; then the royal cohort and body
guards, and the remaining body of the Macedonians close the
rear. The two young sons of the king attend by his side;
Perseus being now in his thirtieth year, Demetrius five years
younger; the former in the full strength of manhood, the
latter in its bloom; the mature offspring of a fortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1860" id="Page_1860">Pg 1860</a></span>
parent, if his mind had been influenced by reason. The custom
was, that when the purificatory sacrifice was finished, the army
should perform their evolutions, and the two lines divided on
both sides should engage in a mock fight. The young princes
were appointed commanders in this mock engagement; but it
was not the mere representation of a battle, for they engaged
as if they were fighting for the throne: many wounds were
given with stakes, nor was any thing but the steel wanting
to give it the form of a regular battle. The party which was
under the command of Demetrius, was far superior. While
Perseus was vexed thereat, his considerate friends rejoiced;
and said, that that very circumstance would afford grounds
for impeaching the youth.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d7" name="d7"></a>7</span>
Each of the princes gave an entertainment that day to
his comrades, who had exercised under his command. Perseus
being invited to supper by Demetrius, refused; kind hospitality
and youthful merriment led both to excess in wine. Thereupon
mention was made of the mock engagement, and numerous remarks
were thrown out against the antagonists in such a manner
as not to spare even the leaders themselves. To learn these
expressions, a spy was sent from among the guests of Perseus;
but not conducting himself with sufficient caution, he was detected
by some young men who happened to come out of the
banqueting-room, and severely beaten. Demetrius, knowing
nothing of this matter, said, &#8220;Why do we not go to my brother,
join with him in merriment, and by our frankness and
gaiety assuage his resentment, if any, arising from the engagement,
as yet remains?&#8221; All with one accord cried out that
they would attend him, except those who were afraid of the
immediate revenge of the spy that had been beaten by them.
When Demetrius pressed these also, they concealed swords
under their clothes, with which they might defend themselves
if any violence should be offered. In the case of domestic
discord, nothing that is concealed can remain so. Both houses
were full of spies and traitors. An informer ran on before
to Perseus, and told him, that four young men, armed with
swords, were coming with Demetrius. Though the reason
was evident, (for he had heard that his guest had been beaten
by them,) yet, for the purpose of blackening the matter, he
ordered his gate to be locked, and from the upper part of the
house and the windows facing the street, he drives away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1861" id="Page_1861">Pg 1861</a></span>
revellers, as if they were come to murder him, from the
entrance to the gate. Demetrius flushed with wine, having
for a little exclaimed loudly at his being shut out, returns
home to his own feast entirely ignorant of the meaning of the
whole proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d8" name="d8"></a>8</span>
Next day, Perseus, as soon as an opportunity of seeing
his father was afforded him, entered the palace, and with looks
expressive of disquietude stood silent in the presence of his
sire but at some distance. Of whom when his father inquired
&#8220;if all was well, and what was the cause of that sadness?&#8221;
he answers, &#8220;Know that it is by the sufferance of
another that your son survives. We are now attacked by my
brother with no secret treachery; he came by night to my
house, with armed men to take away my life, and it was by
shut doors, and the protection afforded by the walls, that I was
saved from his fury.&#8221; When he had inspired into his father
a horror mixed with wonder, he adds, &#8220;If you can listen to
me, I shall cause you to understand the affair as an evident
truth.&#8221; But Philip replied that he would hear him, and ordered
Demetrius to be instantly summoned. He then sent
for two friends of advanced age, Lysimachus and Onomastus,
(who never interfered in the juvenile disputes of the brothers,
and were of late rare visitors in the palace,) that he might have
their assistance in counsel. While his friends are coming he
walked about by himself, secretly revolving many things in
his mind; his son still standing at a distance. On being told
that they had arrived, he retired with his two friends, and
the same number of his life-guards, into an inner apartment;
he permitted each of his sons to bring in three persons unarmed.
Here, having taken his seat, he says, &#8220;I, the most
unhappy of fathers, sit here as judge between my two sons,
the accuser and the accused of the crime of fratricide; about
to find, in my nearest of relations, the foul stain either of
falsehood or a commission of crime. For a long time, indeed,
I have apprehended an impending storm, after I perceived
your mutual looks, which showed no sign of brotherly affection,
and after I had overheard some expressions. But I
sometimes cherished the hope that your passions would
subside, and that your suspicions could be removed; that
even enemies lay down their arms and form a treaty, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1862" id="Page_1862">Pg 1862</a></span>
the private disputes of many have been ended; and I trusted
that the remembrance of your fraternal relationship would at
some time or other occur to you, and of the simplicity and intimacy
that subsisted between you in your boyish days; and
finally, of my instructions, which, I fear, I have fruitlessly
poured into deaf ears. How often have I, in your hearing,
mentioned, with abhorrence, examples of the disagreements of
brothers, and recounted the dreadful consequences of them,
by which themselves, their offspring, their houses, and their
kingdoms, have been utterly ruined. I have represented, on
the other hand, more laudable examples; also the social intercourse
between the two kings of the Laced&aelig;monians, beneficial
to themselves and to their country for many ages; and
that this same state, after the custom of each one arbitrarily
seizing on absolute power prevailed, was quite overturned.
Then, that these brothers, Eumenes and Attalus, raised their
dominions (from so small circumstances, that they were almost
ashamed of the title of king), to an equality with mine,
or with those of Antiochus, or indeed of any monarch of this
age, and by nothing else than by brotherly concord. Nor did
I decline showing you examples even from among the Romans
that I had either seen or heard; as of Titus and Lucius
Quintius, who carried on the war against me; the two Scipios,
Publius and Lucius, who vanquished Antiochus; and their
father and uncle, the lasting harmony of whose life even
death could not dissolve. But neither could the wickedness of
the former, attended by an issue suitable to their crimes, deter
you from your foolish quarrels; nor could the sound judgment
and good fortune of the latter bend you to wisdom. While I
am alive and in health, you have both in your hopes and
wicked desires laid hold on my inheritance. You wish me
to live just so long as that, surviving one, I should, by my
death, make the other king without a competitor. You cannot
endure to have either brother or father. You have no
sense of affection, no religion, your insatiable passion for regal
sway alone has supplied the place of all other feelings.
Come, then, pollute your father&#8217;s ears, contend with mutual
accusations, as you soon will with the sword; speak openly
either whatever truth you can, or are pleased to invent. My
ears are now opened, which henceforward will be shut against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1863" id="Page_1863">Pg 1863</a></span>
all secret charges of one against the other.&#8221; When with furious
passion he had uttered these words, tears gushed from
the whole assembly and a sorrowful silence long prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d9" name="d9"></a>9</span>
At length Perseus spoke to this effect: &#8220;I ought then,
it seems, to have opened my gate in the night, and admitted
those armed revellers, and held out my throat to their swords;
since nothing less than the perpetration of the deed can gain
belief, and since I, who have been assailed by secret treachery
am accosted in the same language as a robber and an
assassin might expect. It is not without reason, that those
people say that you have but one son, Demetrius; and that I
am supposititious, and born of a concubine; for if I held in
your breast the rank of a son, or the affection due to one, you
would wreak your anger not on me, who complain of discovered
treachery, but on him who was the author of it; nor
would my life be so worthless in your eyes, that you should
neither be moved by the danger which I have already undergone,
nor by that to which I must be exposed in future, if
punishment be not inflicted on the assassins. If, therefore, it
be our doom to die secretly let us be silent, only offering
prayers to the gods that the wickedness commenced with me
may terminate in me, and that you be not aimed at through
my side. But if, as nature itself suggests to those encompassed
with perils in a desert place, to implore assistance
even from men whom they had never seen, so I, on seeing
a sword drawn against me, may be allowed to raise my voice.
I beseech you then, by your own person, by the name of father,
(and you long know which of us reveres that title most,)
that you may hear me in the same manner as you would if,
roused by cries and lamentations by night, you had come up,
when I was crying for help, and in the dead of night had
found Demetrius, with armed men, in the porch of my house.
What I should, at that time, and in that case, have exclaimed
with terror, I now, next day, lay before you in form of a
complaint. Brother, it is long since you and I lived together
on the terms of mutual hospitality; you certainly wish to be
king; this my expectation, my age, opposes, the law of nations
opposes, the ancient practice of Macedon opposes, and moreover
the judgment of my father opposes. These you can
surmount by no other means than by shedding my blood.
You are making every scheme and every attempt. Hitherto,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1864" id="Page_1864">Pg 1864</a></span>
either my care or fortune has prevented the fratricide you intended
to commit. Yesterday, on occasion of the purification,
the military exercise and mock representation of a fight,
you almost rendered it a bloody battle; nor was I saved from
death by any other means than by suffering myself and my
party to be overcome. Pretending brotherly sport, you wanted
to drag me from a hostile fight to your house to supper.
Father, do you think that I, to whom they came in arms, that
they might drink with me, would have supped there with unarmed
guests. Do you think that I would have been in no
danger from their swords by night, when they almost killed
me with stakes, of which you were a spectator. Why, Demetrius,
did you come at that time of night; why an enemy
come to a person provoked; why with young men in arms?
I did not venture to trust myself with you as a guest, and shall
I admit you as a reveller, coming with armed men? Father,
if the gate had been open, you would be preparing my
funeral at this moment, in which you are hearing my complaint.
I do not, as an accuser, urge any thing for the
purpose of accusation; nor by collecting doubtful circumstances,
in a train of artful arguments. For what can he say?
Does he deny that he came to my gate with a large party, or
that there were armed men with him? Send for the persons,
whom I will name; they who dared to do this, might dare to
do any thing; nevertheless, they will not dare to deny it. If
I brought before you any who had been caught within my
doors in arms, you would consider this an evident proof;
consider those who confess in the same light as if actually
caught in the fact.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d10" name="d10"></a>10</span>
&#8220;Curse now thirst for dominion. Call up the furies,
the avengers of the wrongs of brothers; but, father, let not
your curses be undiscriminating. Separate and distinguish the
assassin, and him by treachery assailed, and charge the guilty
head. Let him, who intended to kill a brother, feel the wrath of
the gods, of his father; and let him, who was to have perished
by a brother&#8217;s wickedness, find refuge in his father&#8217;s compassion
and justice. For where else shall I seek refuge, who cannot
find safety in the solemn purification of your army, in the exercise
of the troops, in my own house, in a feast, nor in the
night, which nature&#8217;s bounty granted to mankind for a season
of repose. If I go to my brother, according to his invitation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1865" id="Page_1865">Pg 1865</a></span>
I must die. If I admit my brother to a party of pleasure
within my own gates, I must die. Neither by going, nor by
staying, do I escape secret treachery. Whither then shall I
betake me? Father, I have courted nothing save the gods and
thee. I have not the Romans, to whom I may fly. They seek
my destruction, because I grieve at the injuries which they
have done you; because I resent your being deprived of so
many cities, so many nations, and, lately, of the coast of Thrace.
They have no hope that Macedonia will ever be their property,
while either you or I am safe. If a brother&#8217;s wickedness shall
have carried off me, and old age thee, or if even this should
not be waited for, they know that both the king and kingdom
of Macedonia will become theirs. If the Romans had left you
any thing beyond the limits of Macedon, I would suppose
that even that had been left me as a shelter. But I have protection
enough in the Macedonians. You were an eye-witness
yesterday of the attack made on me by the soldiers. What
did they want, but the steel? And what they wanted, in the
day, my brother&#8217;s guests took to themselves in the night.
Why need I mention the greater part of the nobles, who have
placed all their hopes of honour and fortune in the Romans,
and in him who is all-powerful with the Romans? Nor, in
truth, do they prefer him merely to me, his elder brother, but,
they want little of preferring him to yourself, his king and
father. For, he is the person out of regard to whom the senate
remitted to you the intended punishment, who now screens
you from the Roman arms; who thinks it fit that your advanced
age should be under obligation to, and dependent on,
his youth. Him the Romans, him the cities freed from thy
jurisdiction, and him the Macedonians, rejoicing at the peace
with Rome, defend; but for me, father, what hope or protection
have I any where except in thee?</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d11" name="d11"></a>11</span>
&#8220;What do you suppose to be the intention of the letter
lately sent to you by Titus Quintius, in which he not only
says, that you acted wisely for your own interest in sending
Demetrius to Rome, but also advises you to send him
back again, with a greater number of ambassadors, and nobles
of Macedonia? Titus Quintius is now his counsellor, and
master, in every thing. Having renounced you his father, he
has substituted him in your place. There in preference to all
other places their secret plans are concocted. When he desires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1866" id="Page_1866">Pg 1866</a></span>
you to send greater numbers, and the chief men of Macedon
they are seeking assistants in their schemes. For those who
go from this place unchanged and uncorrupted, and impressed
with the idea that they had Philip as their king, return from
thence tainted&mdash;infected by Roman blandishments. Demetrius
alone is every thing to them. They give him the title
of king already, even in his father&#8217;s life-time. If I express my
indignation at these things, you must forthwith understand
that the crime of thirsting for dominion has been laid to my
charge; not only by others, father, but even by you. But
this charge, if made against both, I do not admit; for whom
do I remove from his place, that I may succeed in his room?
My father alone is before me; and that he may long be so, I
entreat the gods. I his survivor, (and may I be so only on
these terms, if, by my desert, he shall wish me to be so,) shall
receive the inheritance of his kingdom, provided my father
shall bequeath it to me. He covets rule, and covets it with
criminal passion, since he hastily overleaps the order of age, of
nature, of the Macedonian custom, and of the laws of nations.
An elder brother stands in his way, to whom by right, and
by the wish of his father, the kingdom belongs. Let him be
carried off: I shall not be the first that acquired a kingdom by
spilling a brother&#8217;s blood. My father, being old, and forlorn
from being bereaved of his son, will rather fear for himself,
than revenge his son&#8217;s death. The Romans will rejoice, they
will approve, they will defend the deed. Father, these prospects
are uncertain, but they are not groundless. For the
matter stands thus: you can repel from me the fatal danger,
by inflicting punishment on those who have taken up arms to
kill me; if success attend the daring deed, you the very same
shall not be able to avenge my death.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d12" name="d12"></a>12</span>
When Perseus concluded his speech, the eyes of all
present were turned to Demetrius, as if he were going to reply
immediately. Then, when it was evident to all that, bathed
in tears, he was unable to speak, silence for a long time reigned:
at length necessity itself, inasmuch as they called on him to
speak, overcame his grief, and he began thus: &#8220;Father, all the
aids which heretofore have been the privilege of the accused,
my accuser has preoccupied. By his tears, counterfeited for
the purpose of working another&#8217;s ruin, he has caused my unfeigned
tears to be suspected by you. Although, ever since I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1867" id="Page_1867">Pg 1867</a></span>
returned from Rome, he, by holding secret consultations with
his confederates, labours night and day to insnare me, yet
nevertheless he represents me in the character, not only of a
conspirator, but of an open assassin and murderer. He terrifies
you with his danger, in order to hasten, through your
means, the ruin of an innocent brother. He asserts, that he
has a place of refuge no where in the world, that I may have no
remaining hope even in thee. Circumvented, destitute, and
helpless as I am, he loads me with odium arising from foreign
favour, which proves detrimental rather than advantageous.
Then how, accuser-like, has he blended that which was the
crime of this night with other invectives against my conduct,
that he might, by representing the tenor of the rest of my life,
throw a colour of guilt both on the late transaction, the true
nature of which you shall soon understand; and that he might
support the other groundless insinuations respecting my views,
wishes, and designs, by this latter, fictitious, fabricated story.
He had, at the same time, this design, that his accusation might
appear to be sudden and by no means premeditated, as if occasioned
by sudden fright and disturbance of this night. But,
Perseus, if I were a traitor against my father and his government;
if I had formed plans with the Romans, or with other
enemies of my father, the tale of last night ought not to have
been waited for; I ought to have been long ago brought to
answer for my treason. And if the former charge apart from
the latter were unfounded, and tended to discover your hatred
towards me, rather than my guilt, it ought on the present day
also to be either omitted or postponed to some future period;
in order that it might clearly appear, whether I plotted
against you; or you, with indeed a strange and singular kind
of hatred, against me. However, I will, as well as I am able
in my present unforeseen perturbation of mind, distinguish
those matters which you have confounded; and I will unveil
the plot of the preceding evening, whether mine or yours.
Perseus wishes it to be believed, that I had formed a design
to take his life, with the view, forsooth, that having removed
the elder brother, on whom by the law of nations, by the
custom of Macedonia, and likewise by your judgment, as he
says, the kingdom was to devolve, I, the younger, should
succeed in the room of him whom I had slain. What, then,
can be the meaning of that other part of his speech, where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1868" id="Page_1868">Pg 1868</a></span>
says that the Romans were courted by me, and from my reliance
on them that I conceived hopes of the crown? For, if I
believed that the Romans possessed such influence, that they
could appoint whomsoever they pleased king of Macedon,
and if I had such confidence in my interest with them, what
need was there of fratricide? Could it be my wish to wear a
diadem stained with a brother&#8217;s blood, or to become execrable
and odious in the eyes of those very people, with whom
whatever interest I may happen to have, has been procured by
zeal, or at least affected integrity of conduct? unless you
believe that Titus Quintius, by whose power and advice you
allege I am at present governed, though he lives in such
cordial affection with his own brother, would recommend to
me to murder mine? He has united for me, not only the
favour of the Romans, but the opinions of the Macedonians,
and the concurring sentiments almost of all the gods and men,
by reason of all which he cannot believe that he would prove
equal to me in the competition. Yet the same man accuses
me of having (though I was inferior to him in every mode of
proceeding) had recourse to an act of wickedness as my last
resource. Do you wish that the formula of the judicial
inquiry should be to this effect, that whichever feared lest the
other should seem more worthy of the throne, shall be deemed
guilty of designing his brother&#8217;s destruction?</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d13" name="d13"></a>13</span>
&#8220;But let us examine the process of this accusation, in
whatever manner it has been fabricated. He has arraigned
me of attempting his life, by several methods; and all these
modes of attack he has crowded into the space of one day. I
intended to kill him by day when we engaged after the purification,
and, if it seems good to the gods, even on the day of
purification. I intended, when I invited him to supper, to
take him off by poison of course. I intended, when some
armed persons followed me to join his party in their conviviality,
to kill him with the sword. You see what sort of
opportunities were chosen for this murder; those of sport,
feasting, and revelling. What? on what sort of a day! On
the day in which the army was purified; in which, after the
royal armour of all the former kings of Macedon was carried
in procession between the divided victim, when we two only
rode along with you, father, at your sides, and the body of the
Macedonian troops followed. Now, even supposing that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1869" id="Page_1869">Pg 1869</a></span>
had formerly been guilty of some crime requiring expiation,
could I, after being purified and expiated in this sacred
solemnity, at the very time especially when I was looking at
the victim laid on each side of our road, revolved in my mind
fratricide, poisons and swords prepared against the feast?
With what other sacred rites could I afterwards atone for the
guilt of a mind, contaminated with every kind of villany?
But whilst his understanding, blinded by a desire for accusing,
wishes to render every thing an object of suspicion, it confounds
one thing with another. For if I intended to take you
off by poison at supper, what could be more incongruous with
my design, than to provoke you to rage by an obstinate contest
and engagement, that you might have reason to refuse,
as you did, my invitation to supper? But when, in your anger,
you had refused, whether ought I to have taken pains to pacify
you, that I might find another opportunity, since I had got
the poison ready, or to pass over, as it were, from that design
to another, namely, that of killing you with the sword, and on
that same day, under pretence of feasting with you? If I
thought that you declined supping with me, through fear for
your life, how could I suppose that you would not, through the
same fear, have declined drinking with me also.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d14" name="d14"></a>14</span>
&#8220;Father, I have no cause to blush, that on a festival
day, among companions of my own age, I should have indulged
too freely in wine; and I wish you would also inquire with
what cheerfulness and mirth yesterday&#8217;s entertainment, at my
house, was rendered festive, that joy also (perhaps a blamable
one) increasing it, our party not having been worsted in the
fight. This my present misfortune, and my fears, have effectual
dissipated the fumes of the liquor; but, if these had
not intervened, we, the conspirators, would have been now
lying fast asleep. If, Perseus, I designed to storm your house,
and after the house had been taken to kill the owner, ought I
not to have refrained from wine for that one day, and to have
kept my soldiers sober? And that I should not be the only
one to defend my cause with excessive candour, my brother
himself also, not in the least inclined to malice or suspicion,
says, I know nothing more, I charge them with nothing more,
than that they came in arms to drink with me. If I should
ask, From what source have you become acquainted with that
very circumstance? you must necessarily acknowledge, either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1870" id="Page_1870">Pg 1870</a></span>
that my house was full of your spies; or that my companions
took arms so openly, as that every one could see them. Lest
he should seem either on a prior occasion to have made any
investigation, or now to adduce arguments for the purpose of
convicting, he desired you to inquire of the persons whom he
would name, whether they had swords, in order that, as it
were, in a doubtful case, when you had investigated into that
which they themselves confessed, they might be deemed convicted.
Why do you not rather desire inquiry to be made
after this, whether they carried swords for the purpose of
killing you; whether by my direction and knowledge? this
you wish to be believed, and not that which they confess, and
what is, indeed, notorious, they say they carried them for the
purpose of defending themselves. Whether they acted right
or wrong, let them account for their own conduct. My cause,
which is no way affected by this act, do not blend with it.
Explain whether we intended to attack you openly, or secretly.
If openly, why had we not all swords? why had no one a sword
except those who had beaten your spy? If privately, what was
the arrangement of our plan? Were four to remain, in order
to fall on you in your sleep, when the banquet broke up, and I
your guest had departed? How would they have escaped
detection, as being strangers, and belonging to me; and, above
all, being liable to suspicion, because they had been in a quarrel
a little before? But how were they to have escaped after
having killed you? Could your house have been taken and
stormed by two swords?</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d15" name="d15"></a>15</span>
&#8220;Why not rather, having dropped that fable of last
night, recur to what really grieves you, what kindles your
envy? Say,&mdash;Why, Demetrius, is mention made any where
of your mounting the throne? Why do you appear, to some,
a more worthy successor to your father&#8217;s dignity than I?
Why do you disturb with doubt and anxiety my hopes, which
would be certain if you were not in being? These are the
thoughts of Perseus, though he does not express them; these
make that man my enemy, these create my accuser; these fill
your house, these your kingdom, with accusations and suspicions.
But, father, as I ought not now either to hope for the crown,
or perhaps ever to contend for it, because I am the younger
brother, and because you wish that I should yield to the elder;
so neither ought I at any former time, or at the present, to act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1871" id="Page_1871">Pg 1871</a></span>
in such a manner as to appear undeserving of you my father,
and of all. For I should attain that by my own vices, not
by yielding to him on whose side is law both human and
divine, not by moderation. You upbraid me with the Romans;
and what ought to be deemed an honour, you convert into a
crime. I did not request, that I should either be delivered a
hostage to the Romans, or sent as an ambassador to Rome.
Being commissioned by you, I did not refuse to go. On both
occasions, I conducted myself in such a manner, as to be no
disgrace to you, to your kingdom, or to the Macedonian nation.
You, therefore, father, have been the cause of my friendship
with the Romans. As long as peace shall subsist between
you and them, so long will I also continue in friendship with
them; but, if war should arise, I, the same who have been
there a hostage, and no unprofitable ambassador in my father&#8217;s
behalf, will be their most determined enemy. Nor do I, this
day, require that the favour of the Romans should be any
advantage to me; I only entreat that it be not detrimental.
It neither commenced in war, nor is it reserved for war. I
have been a pledge of peace; and, to procure a continuance
of peace, I was sent ambassador. Let neither be esteemed an
honour or a crime. Father, if I have been guilty of any undutiful
behaviour towards you, or any criminal behaviour towards
my brother, I beg to be freed from no punishment. If
I be innocent, let me not, I beseech you, be destroyed by envy
when I cannot by crime. My brother&#8217;s accusation, this day,
is not the first that he has brought against me; but it is the
first made openly, and owing to no offence given him by me.
If my father were angry with me, it would become you, the
elder brother, to intercede for the younger, you to obtain pardon
for his youth, and you for his error; but in the very person
from whom I ought to receive protection, in him I meet
my ruin. From a feast and revelry I have been hurried,
almost half asleep, to plead my cause on a charge of fratricide.
Without advocates, without patrons, I am compelled to
plead my own cause. If I were to speak for another, I would
have taken time to study and compose a speech; though, what
else would I endanger than that of my reputation for abilities.
But, before I knew why I had been summoned, I heard you,
in a paroxysm of passion, ordering me to account for my conduct,
and my brother accusing me. He employed against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1872" id="Page_1872">Pg 1872</a></span>
me a speech long before prepared and studied; I had only
the time in which the accusations were recited, for hearing
what were the impeachments. During that short space
whether should I listen to my accuser, or study a defence?
Thunder-struck by the sudden and unthought-of calamity, I
was scarcely capable of understanding what was alleged against
me, much less of being sufficiently aware what defence I
should make. What hope indeed could I have, if I had not
my father as judge, with whom, though I am outstripped by
an elder brother in affection, yet surely, when accused, I ought
not to be outstripped in his compassion. For my prayer is,
that you would save me, for my sake, and for your own; he
demands, that, for his security, you should put me to death.
What do you think will he do, when you shall have delivered
the kingdom into his hands, who even now thinks it reasonable
that he should be gratified with my blood?&#8221; While he
was uttering these words, tears interrupted his breath and
voice at the same time. Philip, having sent them away, and
conferred a short time with his friends, declared, that &#8220;he
could not from a single hour&#8217;s discussion give a formulary
judgment on the cause between them, but by a scrutiny into
the conduct and manners of both, and a close observation of
their words and actions, on occasions great and small.&#8221; That
it appeared clearly to all, that the charge relating to the preceding
night was effectually refuted; but that Demetrius&#8217;
favour with the Romans had been an object of suspicion, as
being too great. These, as it were, the seeds of the Macedonian
war which was to be waged with Perseus, in particular, were
sown, when Philip was still alive.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d16" name="d16"></a>16</span>
Both the consuls set out into Liguria, which at that
time was the only consular province. A supplication for one
day was decreed because prosperity had attended their affairs
in that quarter. About two thousand Ligurians came to the
extreme borders of the Gallic province, where Marcellus lay
encamped, requesting him to receive their submission. Marcellus,
having ordered the Ligurians to wait in the same place,
consulted the senate through the medium of a letter. The
senate ordered Marcus Ogulnius, pr&aelig;etor, to write back to
Marcellus, that &#8220;it would have been more proper for the consuls,
whose province it was, than for them, to decide what
might tend to the interest of the republic; that in this case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1873" id="Page_1873">Pg 1873</a></span>
too it was their pleasure, if he should receive the surrender of
the Ligurians, that their arms should not be taken from them
admitted to a surrender, and that the senate thought
proper that the Ligurians should be sent to the consul. The
pr&aelig;tors arrived at the same time in Spain; Publius Manlius
in the Farther province, which he had governed in his former
pr&aelig;torship, and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus in the Hither one,
and he received the command of the army from Terentius;
for the Farther province, by the death of the propr&aelig;tor, Publius
Sempronius, had been without a governor. The Celtiberians
attacked Fulvius Flaccus while besieging a town of the
Spaniards, called Urbicua. Many severe actions were fought
there, and many of the Roman soldiers killed and wounded.
They were vanquished by Fulvius&#8217; perseverance, because he
could by no force be diverted from the siege; the Celtiberians,
wearied out with so many battles, retired. The city, having
lost their assistance, was within a few days taken and sacked;
the pr&aelig;tor bestowed the booty on the soldiers. Fulvius
having taken this town, and Publius Manlius having only
gathered together his army, which had been scattered, without
having achieved any other memorable action, led their
armies into winter quarters. These were the transactions of
that summer in Spain. Terentius, who had come home from
that province, entered the city in ovation. He carried in the
procession nine thousand three hundred and twenty pounds&#8217;
weight of silver, eighty pounds&#8217; weight of gold, and two golden
crowns of the weight of sixty-seven pounds.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d17" name="d17"></a>17</span>
In the same year the Romans were arbitrators on the
spot in a dispute, subsisting between the people of Carthage
and king Masinissa, about a tract of ground. This ground
Gala, father of Masinissa, had taken from the Carthaginians.
Syphax had expelled Gala, and afterwards, from respect to
Hasdrubal, his father-in-law, had made a present of it to the
Carthaginians. In this year, Masinissa had expelled the
Carthaginians. This matter was debated before the Romans
with no less mental ardour than they had contended for it
with the sword, even in the field of battle. The Carthaginians
claimed the ground first, as having been the property of their
ancestors; and next, because it had come to them from
Syphax. Masinissa urged, that &#8220;he had retaken possession
of it as part of his father&#8217;s kingdom, and held it under the law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1874" id="Page_1874">Pg 1874</a></span>
of nations; and that he had the advantage, both in the merits
of his cause and in the present possession. That, in this discussion,
he had no other fear, than lest the moderation of the
Romans might operate to his loss, whilst they dreaded the appearance
of any partiality to a king who was their friend and
ally, in prejudice to the common enemy of him and them.&#8221;
The deputies did not alter the right of possession, but referred
the cause entire to the senate at Rome. There was nothing
done afterwards in Liguria. The inhabitants, at first, retired
into pathless forests; and afterwards, disbanding their army,
separated in every direction among the villages and forts.
The consuls, too, wished to disband their forces, and consulted
the senators on this matter. They ordered that one
of them should discharge his troops, and come to Rome to
elect magistrates for the year; and that the other, with his
legions, should pass the winter at Pis&aelig;. A report prevailed,
that the transalpine Gauls were arming their young men, and
it was not known on what quarter of Italy that multitude
would pour itself. The consuls settled the matter between
them,&mdash;that Cneius B&aelig;bius should go home to the elections,
because his brother, Marcus B&aelig;bius, was a candidate for the
consulship.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d18" name="d18"></a>18</span>
The assembly for the election of consuls was held, and
Publius Cornelius Cethegus and Marcus B&aelig;bius Tamphilus
were chosen. The pr&aelig;tors were afterwards elected, Quintus
Fabius Maximus, Quintus Fabius Buteo, Tiberius Claudius
Nero, Quintus Petillius Spurinus, Marcus Pinarius Posca, and
Lucius Duronius. When the magistrates entered into office,
the provinces fell to these by lot in the following order: to
the consuls, Liguria; to the pr&aelig;tors, Quintus Petillius, the
city, and Quintus Fabius Maximus, the foreign jurisdiction;
to Quintus Fabius Buteo, Gaul; to Tiberius Claudius Nero,
Sicily; to Marcus Pinarius, Sardinia; and to Lucius Duronius,
Apulia, to which was annexed Istria also, because information
was received at Tarentum and Brundusium, that
the lands bordering on the sea were infested by robberies
committed by foreign piratical ships. The Massilians made
the same complaint, with regard to the ships of the Ligurians.
The armies were then voted, to the consuls four Roman
legions (each consisting of five thousand two hundred foot
and three hundred horse); and fifteen thousand foot and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1875" id="Page_1875">Pg 1875</a></span>
eight hundred horse of the allies and Latins. In the
Spains, the old pra&aelig;tors were continued in command, with the
armies which they then had; and as an augmentation, there
were voted for them, three thousand Roman citizens with two
hundred horse, and six thousand foot and three hundred
horse of the Latin confederates. Nor was the business of
the fleet neglected. The consuls were ordered to constitute
duumvirs for conducting that department; by whom, twenty
ships which they had launched were to be manned with
Roman citizens who had been in servitude; with this proviso
only, that free-born officers should command them. The duty
of guarding the coast was so arranged between the duumvirs,
each of whom had the command of ten ships, that the promontory
of Minerva formed the point of division between them:
one was to defend the part on the right, as far as Marseilles;
the other, that on the left, extending to the town of Barium.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d19" name="d19"></a>19</span>
Many horrid prodigies were seen at Rome this year,
and reported from abroad. It rained blood in the courts of the
temples of Vulcan and Concord, and the priests reported that
spears moved, and that the image of Juno Sospita at Lanuvium
shed tears. There was a pestilence in the country, in
the market towns and market-places: and so violent was it in
the city, that Libitina could scarcely supply the requisites for
burying the dead. These prodigies, and the mortality,
alarmed the senate so much, that they ordered the consuls to
sacrifice to such gods as they thought proper, victims of the
larger kinds, and likewise the decemvirs to consult the books.
Pursuant to their direction, a supplication for one day was
proclaimed, to be performed at every shrine in Rome. On the
authority of these same, both the senate voted, and the consuls
announced, that there should be a supplication and holidays
for three days throughout the whole of Italy. The pestilence
raged with so great fury, that when, in consequence of the
revolt of the Corsicans, and a war raised in Sardinia by the Iliensians,
it seemed good, that, from among the Latin allies, eight
thousand foot and three hundred horse should be raised, whom
Marcus Pinarius the pr&aelig;tor should convey with him into Sardinia;&mdash;the
consuls returned a representation, that so great a
number of men had died, and so many were sick, in every
place that the number of soldiers could not be made up. The
pr&aelig;tor was ordered to take from Cneius B&aelig;bius, proconsul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1876" id="Page_1876">Pg 1876</a></span>
who was in winter quarters at Pis&aelig;, as many soldiers as would
make up the deficiency, and transport them from thence to
Sardinia. To Lucius Duronius the pr&aelig;tor, to whose lot
Apulia had fallen, was given in addition the charge of making
inquiry concerning the Bacchanalians; for some remaining
seeds of the evils, formerly excited by those people, had shown
themselves there the year before. The inquiries were rather
commenced under the pr&aelig;tor, Lucius Pupius, than brought to
any issue; the senate therefore ordered the new pr&aelig;tor to cut
up that evil by the roots, lest it might spread again more extensively.
The consuls, also, by direction of the senate, proposed
to the people certain laws concerning canvassing for
elections.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d20" name="d20"></a>20</span>
They next introduced the embassies to audience.
And first, those of the kings, Eumenes and Ariarathes the
Cappadocian; and Pharnaces of Pontus. No further answer
was given to these, than that the senate would send persons to
examine, and decide their disputes. Ambassadors from the
Laced&aelig;monian exiles, and from the Ach&aelig;ans, were next
brought in. Hopes were given to the exiles, that the senate
would write to the Ach&aelig;ans that they should be restored.
The Ach&aelig;ans gave an account, to the satisfaction of the senate,
of the recovery of Messene, and the settlement of affairs
there. From Philip, king of Macedonia, came two ambassadors
also,&mdash;Philocles and Appelles; not on any business with
the senate, but rather to pry into and inquire concerning the
correspondence with the Romans, of which Perseus had accused
Demetrius, and, particularly, into that with Titus
Quintius, concerning the kingdom, to the prejudice of his
brother. The king had employed these men, believing them
unbiassed and inclined in favour of neither party; but they
were accomplices and agents of Perseus, in his treacherous
designs against his brother. Demetrius, ignorant of all except
the villanous scheme of his brother which had lately
broke out, at first neither utterly despaired, nor yet entertained
much hope of being reconciled with his father; but
afterwards he trusted less and less every day to Philip&#8217;s
affection, having observed that an audience with him was
prevented by his brother. Wherefore, not to increase the
suspicions lie laboured under, he used extreme circumspection
in all his words and actions, and carefully avoided all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1877" id="Page_1877">Pg 1877</a></span>
mention of, and communication with, the Romans; to such a
degree as to wish that they should not write, as he knew that
his father&#8217;s mind was principally exasperated by charges of
this nature.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d21" name="d21"></a>21</span>
Philip, lest his troops should be enervated by inactivity,
and at the same time, to avert all suspicion of his harbouring
any design of a war with Rome, ordered his army to assemble
at Stobi, in P&aelig;onia; and thence he led it on into M&aelig;dica.
He had been seized with an earnest desire of ascending to the
summit of Mount H&aelig;mus, for he gave credit to a vulgar
opinion, that from thence could be seen at once the Pontic
and Adriatic Seas, the river Danube, and the Alps; and he
thought that the having a view of all those places, would be
of no small consequence towards forming his plans of a war
with Rome. On inquiry, from people acquainted with the
country, respecting the ascent to Mount H&aelig;mus, when it was
ascertained from them all, that there was no way by which an
army could go up it, but that there was access for a small
party, lightly accoutred, that he might soothe with familiar
discourse his younger son, whom he had determined not to
take with him, he first asked his opinion, &#8220;whether, as the
difficulty of the journey was represented to be so great, he
ought to persist in his design, or not?&#8221; He added, that, if he
should resolve to proceed, he could not forget the caution of
Antigonus, respecting undertakings of that kind; who being
tossed about by a violent storm, when he had all his family in
the same ship with him, was said to have advised his sons to
remember, and hand down to their children, this maxim:
&#8220;never to have the hardihood to rush into danger themselves,
and their whole family together.&#8221; He would therefore attend
to this warning, and not expose his two sons at once to the
chance of those perils, which were represented to lie in his
way; and as he meant to take his elder son with him, he
would send back the younger into Macedon, as a reserve to
his hopes, and as guardian of the kingdom.&#8221; It did not
escape Demetrius that he was sent out of the way, that lie
might not be present at their deliberations, when, in view of
those places, they should consult which were the shortest
roads to the Adriatic Sea and to Italy, and what was the
general plan to be pursued in the war. He was obliged however
not only to obey his father on the occasion, but to express<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1878" id="Page_1878">Pg 1878</a></span>
his approbation of the measure, lest a reluctant obedience
might beget suspicion. In order that his journey into Macedonia
might be safe, Didas, one of the king&#8217;s general officers
and governor of P&aelig;onia, was ordered to escort him with a
small party of men. Perseus took this man, as well as most
of his father&#8217;s friends, into the conspiracy to ruin his brother,
from the time that it became plain to every one, from the
tendency of the king&#8217;s feelings, to which of the two the
inheritance of the throne should come; and Perseus charged
him on this occasion, to insinuate himself by every kind of
obsequiousness into the most familiar communication with
Demetrius, so as to draw from him all his secrets, and to pry
into his hidden thoughts. The prince, therefore, set out with
a guard more dangerous to him than if he had gone alone.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d22" name="d22"></a>22</span>
Philip marched first into M&aelig;dica, then crossing the
deserts that lie between M&aelig;dica and H&aelig;mus, at length, at his
seventh encampment, he reached the foot of the mountain.
There he halted one day, to make choice of those who were to
accompany him, and on the next proceeded on his journey.
At first, while they ascended the lower parts of the hills, the
fatigue was moderate; but as they advanced upwards, they
found the ground more thickly covered with woods, and many
places impassable. They then came to a part of the way so
shaded by the thickness of the trees, and the branches so
interwoven with each other, that the sky could scarcely be
seen; but when they drew near to the top, what is rarely
seen in other places, the whole tract was covered with so
thick a fog, that they were impeded no less than if they were
journeying by night. At last, on the third day, they arrived
at the summit. On coming down they did not discountenance
the vulgar opinion, more, I suppose, lest the folly of the
journey should be exposed to derision, than that it was
there possible to see those seas, and mountains, and rivers,
so widely distant from each other. They were all greatly
fatigued by the difficulty of the way; and chiefly the king
himself, in proportion as he was less fitted for exertion, owing
to his advanced age. After sacrificing to Jupiter and the
sun, on two altars which he consecrated on the spot, he
descended in two days, though the ascent had cost him three:
for he was particularly afraid of the night cold, which even
at the rising of the dog-star was like the cold of winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1879" id="Page_1879">Pg 1879</a></span>
After struggling with numerous hardships during those days,
he found his camp in a condition not more pleasing, for as it
lay in a country enclosed on all sides by deserts, there was
extreme want. He halted therefore but one day, to refresh
those whom he had taken with him, and then hastened away
into the country of the Dentheletians, with a rapid march
close resembling flight. These were allies, but the Macedonians,
on account of their own necessities, plundered their
country, as if it belonged to an enemy; for they first pillaged
the country houses, and afterwards ravaged several villages,
overwhelming the king with shame, when he heard the cries
of his allies, calling in vain on the gods who witnessed their
league, and on himself by name. Having carried off corn
from hence, he marched back into M&aelig;dica, and laid siege to a
town called Petra. He pitched his camp in a plain, and sent
his son Perseus with a small party to attack the city from the
higher ground. The townsmen, when danger pressed them
on all sides, gave hostages, and for the present surrendered
themselves; but as soon as the army retired, regardless of the
hostages, they deserted the city, and fled into fastnesses and
mountains. Philip returned to Macedon, after having exhausted
his troops by every kind of fatigue, without effecting
any purpose, and with his suspicions of his son augmented
through the treachery of the governor Didas.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d23" name="d23"></a>23</span>
This man being sent, as before mentioned, to escort
Demetrius, had, by flattering discourses, and even expressing
his own indignation at the treatment shown him, imposed on
the open temper of the youth, who was too much off his guard,
and justly incensed against his relations; and by a voluntary
offer of his assistance in all his measures, and giving a solemn
assurance of fidelity, he elicited his secrets. Demetrius was
meditating flight to Rome; and the governor of P&aelig;onia appeared
to him to have been sent by the kindness of the gods to
aid him in his design;&mdash;through whose province he supposed
he might make his escape. This scheme was immediately betrayed
to his brother, and, by his direction, discovered to his
father. A letter was brought the king while he was besieging
Petra; and in consequence of it, Herodotus, who was the
most intimate friend of Demetrius, was taken into custody,
and an order was given that Demetrius himself should be
guarded, without his perceiving it. These occurrences, added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1880" id="Page_1880">Pg 1880</a></span>
to what had passed before, made the king&#8217;s arrival in Macedon
a sad one. The present charges had an effect on him;
yet he resolved to wait the return of those whom he had sent
to Rome, to procure intelligence of every particular. After
he had passed several months under this uneasiness and
anxiety, the ambassadors, who had preconcerted before they
left Macedon, what information they should bring home from
Rome, at last arrived; who, in addition to other grounds of
accusation, produced to the king a forged letter, sealed with
a counterfeit seal of Titus Quintius. In this letter was a
kind of interceding apology, that if the young prince, misled
by the ambition of reigning, had offered some propositions to
him on the subject, yet he was sure that &#8220;Demetrius would
never attempt any thing against his relations; and that he
himself was not such an individual as to appear capable of
giving an undutiful advice.&#8221; This letter confirmed the
charges made by Perseus: Herodotus was, therefore, immediately
put to the rack, which he endured a long time, and
died under the torture, without giving information of any
sort.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d24" name="d24"></a>24</span>
Perseus now brought before his father a second formal
accusation against Demetrius. His preparations for flight
through P&aelig;onia were alleged against him, and his having
bribed certain persons to accompany him on the journey; but
the forged letter of Titus Quintius pressed hardest on him.
There was, however, no severe sentence pronounced openly,
in order that he might be put to death in secrecy, which they
considered a preferable course: nor was this done through
regard for himself, but lest the inflicting punishment on him
might unmask designs against the Romans. The king himself
having occasion to go from Thessalonica to Demetrias, sent
Demetrius, with the same attendant Didas, to Astr&aelig;um in
P&aelig;onia, and Perseus to Amphipolis, to receive hostages from
the Thracians, and is said, on parting with Didas, to have
given him directions to put his son to death. A sacrifice was
either intended or counterfeited by Didas, and Demetrius,
being invited to be present at the solemnity, came from
Astr&aelig;um to Heraclea. It is said that poison was administered
to him in that supper. The moment he had swallowed the
draught, he was conscious of its deadly properties; and being
quickly after seized with violent pains, left the banquet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1881" id="Page_1881">Pg 1881</a></span>
and retired to a chamber, where he continued for some time in
agony, complaining of the cruelty of his father, inveighing
against the fratricide of Perseus, and the villany of Didas.
Then one Thyrsis of Stubera, and one Alexander of Ber&#339;a,
were sent in, who, covering his head and mouth with blankets,
suffocated him. In this manner perished that innocent youth,
since in his case his enemies were not even content with a
common kind of murder.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d25" name="d25"></a>25</span>
While these matters were passing in Macedon, Lucius
&AElig;milius Paullus, being, on the expiration of his consulate,
continued in command, led his army at the commencement of
spring into the country of the Ingaunian Ligurians. He had
no sooner pitched his camp in the enemy&#8217;s territory, than ambassadors
came to him under pretext of suing for peace, but
in reality as spies. When Paullus declared that he would
enter into no treaty whatever, unless they first surrendered;
to this they did not object, but said that it would require time
to procure the consent of such a rude kind of people. When,
for that purpose, a suspension of arms for ten days was
granted, then they further requested that his men might not
go beyond the mountains for wood or forage, for that was
the part of their lands which they had under tillage. After
they obtained this request, they collected all their forces
behind those mountains, which they had prevented the Romans
from approaching; and on a sudden, with a vast multitude,
assaulted every gate of his camp at once. During that
whole day, they prosecuted the attack with such vigour, that
Paullus had not time to march out of the camp, nor room to
draw out his troops: crowding together at the gates, they
defended their camp by blocking up the passage, rather than
by fighting. When the enemy had retired a little before
sun-set, the general despatched two horsemen to Pis&aelig;, to
Cneius B&aelig;bius, proconsul, with a letter, requesting him to
come with all speed to his relief, as he was besieged in the
midst of a truce. B&aelig;bius had given up his army to Marcus
Pinarius, the pr&aelig;tor, who was going into Sardinia, but he
informed the senate by letter that Lucius &AElig;milius was besieged
by the Ligurians, and also wrote to Marcus Claudius
Marcellus, whose province lay the nearest, that, if he thought
proper, he should march his army out of Gaul into Liguria,
and relieve Lucius &AElig;milius from the blockade. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1882" id="Page_1882">Pg 1882</a></span>
succours would have come too late. The Ligurians returned
next day to the attack of the camp. &AElig;milius, although he
was aware that they would come, and although he could have
drawn out his army to meet them, yet kept his men within
the lines, in order that he might protract the business until
such time as B&aelig;bius should come with his army from Pis&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d26" name="d26"></a>26</span>
B&aelig;bius&#8217;s letter caused a great alarm at Rome, and it
was increased by this circumstance, that, in a few days after
Marcellus coming to Rome, having given up the command of
the army to Fabius, banished all hope of a possibility of the
forces, then in Gaul, being removed into Liguria; for hostilities
had commenced with the Istrians, who obstructed the
settlement of the colony of Aquileia; and, as Fabius had led
his army thither, he could not quit that country now that the
war was begun. There was but one hope of relief, and even
that too slow for the exigency of the time,&mdash;this was, that the
consuls might hasten their march into that province, and the
senators earnestly pressed them to do so. The consuls declared
that they would not set out until the levies were completed,
and that no indolence in them, but the violence of the
epidemic sickness, was the cause of their being so long in
finishing the levy. However, they could not withstand the
united wishes of the whole senate, in urging them to depart
in the military habit, and to proclaim a day to the troops
which they had enlisted, on which they should assemble at
Pis&aelig;. Authority was given them to enlist hasty levies on
their march, wherever they should go, and take them with
them. Orders were likewise issued to the pr&aelig;tors, Quintus
Petillius and Quintus Fabius, that Petillius should raise two
tumultuary legions of Roman citizens, and compel every
person under fifty years of age to enlist; and that Fabius
should demand from the Latin allies, fifteen thousand foot and
eight hundred horse. Two commanders were appointed to
the fleet, Caius Matienus and Caius Lucretius, and ships
were put in readiness for them. An order was given
Matienus, whose station was at the Gallic bay, to steer his
squadron, with all expedition, to the coast of Liguria, and to
try if he could be of any service to Lucius &AElig;milius and his
army.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d27" name="d27"></a>27</span>
&AElig;milius, when no aid appeared in any quarter, believing
that his couriers had been intercepted, resolved to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1883" id="Page_1883">Pg 1883</a></span>
wait no longer, but to make a trial of fortune by himself; and
for this purpose, before the coming of the enemy, who now
made their attacks with less briskness and vigour, he drew up
his troops at the four gates, that, on a signal being given,
might sally out from all sides at once. To four independent
cohorts of auxiliaries, he added two others, and gave
the command to Marcus Valerius, lieutenant-general, with
orders to make his sally by the pr&aelig;torian gate. At the right
gate of the first cohort he formed the spearmen of the first
legion, placing the first-rank men of the same legion in reserve:
Marcus Servilius and Lucius Sulpicius, military
tribunes, had the command of these. The third legion was
drawn up opposite to the left gate of the first cohort, with this
difference only, that here the first-rank men were posted in
front, and the spearmen in reserve. Sextus Julius C&aelig;sar and
Lucius Aurelius Cotta, military tribunes, had the command
of this legion. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, lieutenant-general,
with the right wing of the allies, was posted at the qu&aelig;storian
gate: and two cohorts, with the veterans of the two legions,
were ordered to stay within to guard the camp. The general
himself went round by all the gates, haranguing the troops,
and excited the wrath of the soldiers by all the incentives that
he could use; at one time declaiming against the treachery of
the enemy, who after suing for peace, and obtaining a truce,
had come during the very time of that truce, in violation of
the law of nations, to attack his camp; at another, setting before
them what a shame it was that a Roman army should be
besieged by Ligurians, people more properly styled robbers
than a regular enemy. &#8220;With what face,&#8221; continued he, &#8220;if
you make your way hence by the assistance of others, and not
by your own valour, will any of you meet, I do not say those
soldiers that conquered Hannibal, or Philip, or Antiochus, the
greatest kings and generals of the present age, but those who
often drove those very Ligurians before them, flying like
cattle through pathless forests, and put them to the sword?
What the Spaniards, the Gauls, the Macedonians, or Carthaginians,
never dared to attempt, a Ligurian enemy dares: he
marches up to the trenches of a Roman camp, unexpectedly
besieges and assaults it; although, formerly, we, searching
carefully the recesses of the forests, were with difficulty able
to find them lurking in their hiding-places.&#8221; This was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1884" id="Page_1884">Pg 1884</a></span>
answered by a general clamour, &#8220;that it was no fault of the
soldiers, as no one had given them the order to sally forth
Let him but give the order, and he should soon be convinced,
that both the Romans and the Ligurians were the same that
ever they were.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d28" name="d28"></a>28</span>
There were two camps of the Ligurians on the hither
side of the mountains, from which, on the former days, they
had marched forward at sun-rise, all in order and regular
array. On this day they did not take arms until they had
made a full meal of food and wine; and then they came out in
loose order, and regardless of their ranks, as they expected
with certainty, that the enemy would not venture out beyond
the rampart. As they were approaching in this disorderly
manner, the shout being raised by every one in the camp at
once, even by the suttlers and servants, the Romans rushed
out by all the gates at the same time. This event was so
entirely unexpected by the Ligurians, that they were confounded
no less than if they had been caught in an ambush.
For a short time, some appearance of a fight was maintained,
and then followed a hasty flight, and a general slaughter of the
fugitives. When the signal was given to the cavalry to
mount their horses, and not to suffer any to escape, they were
all driven in a confused flight to their camps, and soon beaten
out of them also. Above fifteen thousand of the Ligurians
were killed, and two thousand five hundred taken. In three
days after, the whole state of the Ingaunian Ligurians gave
hostages, and surrendered. The masters and crews of the
ships, which had been employed in piracies, were carefully
sought, for, and thrown into prison; and thirty-two ships of
that description were taken by Caius Matienus, one of the
two on the Ligurian coast. Lucius Aurelius Cotta, and Caius
Sulpicius Gallus, were sent to Rome to announce these transactions
and bring a letter to the senate, and at the same time
to request that, as the business of the province was finished,
Lucius &AElig;milius might have permission to leave it, and to
bring away his troops and disband them. Both requests were
granted by the senate, and a supplication was decreed, at all
the shrines, for three days; the pr&aelig;tors Petillius and Fabius
received orders, the former to discharge the city legions, the
latter to excuse the allies and Latins from the levies, and
that the city pr&aelig;tor should write to the consuls, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1885" id="Page_1885">Pg 1885</a></span>
senate thought proper that the occasional soldiers, enlisted on
account of the sudden alarm, should be immediately discharged.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d29" name="d29"></a>29</span>
The colony of Gravisca was established this year in a
district of Etruria, formerly taken from the Tarquinians, and
five acres of land were given to each settler. The commissioners
who conducted it were Caius Calpurnius Piso,
Publius Claudius Pulcher, and Caius Terentius Istra. The
year was rendered remarkable by a drought, and a scarcity of
the productions of the earth. It is handed down on record,
that during the space of six months no rain fell. In the same
year, some workmen in the farm of Lucius Petillius, a notary,
at the foot of the Janiculum, digging the ground deeper than
usual, discovered two stone chests, about eight feet long and
four broad, the covers of which were soldered with lead.
Both the chests had inscriptions in Greek and Latin letters,
one signifying that therein was buried Numa Pompilius, son
of Pompo, and king of the Romans; the other, that therein
were contained the books of Numa Pompilius. When the
owner of the ground had, by the advice of his friends, opened
these chests, the one which, according to its inscription, contained
the body of the king, was found perfectly empty, without
any trace of a human body or of any thing else having
ever been in it; the whole being consumed by the decay of
such a number of years. In the other were found two
bundles, tied round with waxed cords, and each containing
seven books, not only entire, but apparently quite fresh.
Seven were in Latin, and related to the pontifical law; and
seven in Greek, containing the doctrines of philosophy, such as
might have been known in that age. Valerius Antias adds,
that they contained the doctrines of Pythagoras, supporting,
by this plausible fiction, the credit of the vulgar opinion, that
Numa had been a disciple of Pythagoras. The books were
read, first, by Petillius&#8217;s friends, who were present at the discovery.
Afterwards, when they became publicly spoken of in
consequence of many others reading them, Quintus Petillius,
the city prætor, having a desire to read those books, borrowed
them from Lucius Petillius, with whom he was familiarly
acquainted, in consequence of Quintus Petillius having, when
qu&aelig;stor, made him a notary, and chosen him as one of ten.
On reading the principal heads of the contents, he perceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1886" id="Page_1886">Pg 1886</a></span>
that most of them had a tendency to undermine the established
system of religious doctrines, and, thereupon, he told Lucius
Petillius, that &#8220;he was determined to throw those books into
the fire; but before he did so, he gave him leave, if he thought
he had any right or appeal to demand the restitution of
them, to make the trial, which he might do and preserve his
favour.&#8221; The notary applied to the plebeian tribunes, and
the tribunes referred the matter to the senate. The pr&aelig;tor
declared, that he was ready to make oath that those books
ought not to be read or preserved; and the senate decreed,
that &#8220;the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s having offered his oath ought to be deemed
sufficient evidence that those books should, without delay, be
burned in the comitium, and that such a price should be paid
to the owner as might be judged reasonable by the pr&aelig;tor,
Quintus Petillius, and the majority of the plebeian tribunes.&#8221;
The notary did not receive the money. The books, however,
were burned in the comitium, in the view of the people, the
fire being made by the public servants, whose duty &#8220;it was to
assist at sacrifices.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d30" name="d30"></a>30</span>
A formidable war broke out this summer in the Hither
Spain, where the Celtiberians assembled such a force as they
had hardly ever brought into the field before, amounting to no
less than thirty-five thousand men. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus
was governor of this province, who, because he heard that the
Celtiberians were arming their young men, drew together all
the succours he could procure from the allies. But he was by
no means equal to the enemy in point of numbers. Early in
spring, he marched his army into Carpetania, and fixed his
camp close to the town of &AElig;bura, in which he posted a small
garrison. In a few days after, the Celtiberians pitched their
camp at the foot of a hill, about two miles from that place.
When the Roman pr&aelig;tor was informed of their approach, he
detached his brother, Marcus Fulvius, with two troops of the
allied horse, to the enemy&#8217;s post, to take a view of them;
ordering him to advance as near as possible to their rampart,
so as to form a judgment of the size of the camp; and not to
engage in fight, but to retreat if he should see the enemy&#8217;s
cavalry coming out. He acted according to his instructions,
and for several days there was nothing further done than
these two troops showing themselves, and then retreating
when the enemy&#8217;s cavalry sallied from their tents. At length,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1887" id="Page_1887">Pg 1887</a></span>
the Celtiberians came out, with their entire force of horse and
foot together, and drawing up in a line, posted themselves
about midway between the two camps. The whole plain was
level, and convenient for fighting, and here the Spaniards
stood waiting for their enemy. The Roman general kept his
men within the rampart during four successive days, while
the others constantly drew up theirs, and formed in the same
place. No motion was made by the Romans; and from that
time the Celtiberians, because they had not an opportunity of
engaging, remained quiet in their camp; their cavalry only
advanced as out-posts, to be ready in case of any movement
being made by Fulvius. Both parties went for wood and
forage behind their own camps, neither interrupting the
other.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d31" name="d31"></a>31</span>
When the Roman pr&aelig;tor thought that, by his inactivity
for so many days, he had created in the Celtiberians a firm
persuasion that he would not be first in any movement, he
ordered Lucius Acilius, with the left wing of allies and six
thousand provincial auxiliaries, to make the circuit of a
mountain behind the enemy, and as soon as he should hear
the shout, to pour down from them on their camp. This
party, to avoid being seen, set out in the night. At the dawn
of day Flaccus sent Caius Scribonius, a pr&aelig;fect of the allies,
with the allied cavalry of the left wing, to the enemy&#8217;s rampart;
when the Celtiberians, observing that they approached nearer,
and were also more numerous than usual, all their cavalry
poured forth from the camp, and at the same time the signal
is given to the infantry to sally forth. Scribonius, according
to his instructions, no sooner heard the neighing of the
enemy&#8217;s cavalry than he wheeled about and retreated to the
camp, on which they pursued with the more violence. First
the cavalry, and in a short time the line of infantry, came up,
confidently expecting that they should be able to assault the
camp before night, and they were five hundred paces, not
more, from the rampart. Flaccus, therefore, thinking that
they were now drawn far enough from their camp, to hinder
them from giving it any succour, as he had his troops already
formed within the works, burst out from three sides at once;
and at the same time raised the shout, not only to inspire
ardour for the fight, but also that the party on the mountain
might hear it. Nor did these make any delay, but, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1888" id="Page_1888">Pg 1888</a></span>
to their orders, poured down on the camp, where five thousand
men, not more, were left to guard it, and when the
smallness of their numbers, the multitude of the assailants
and the unexpectedness of the affair, had struck terror into
them, the camp was taken almost without a struggle. Acilius
set fire to that part of the camp which was most exposed to
the view of the combatants.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d32" name="d32"></a>32</span>
The Celtiberians in the rear of their own line first observed
the flames, and the news spread quickly through the
whole army, that the camp was lost, and was even then completely
in a blaze, which filled them with dismay, while it gave
fresh spirits to the Romans; for now the shouts of victory
raised by their friends struck their ear, and the enemies&#8217; camp
appeared all on fire. The Celtiberians hesitated for some time,
uncertain how to act, but when they considered that, in case of
a defeat, they had no place of refuge, and that their only hope
now lay in their arms, they renewed the combat afresh, with
greater obstinacy. Their centre was pressed hard by the fifth
legion; but their men advanced with more confidence against
the left wing, where they saw that the Romans had posted
the provincial auxiliaries, troops of their own kind. The left
wing of the Romans was now near being defeated, had not the
seventh legion come to its support. At the same time, the
troops left in garrison at &AElig;bura came up during the heat of
the battle, and Acilius closed on the enemy&#8217;s rear. Thus surrounded,
the Celtiberians were, for a long time, cut off in
great numbers, and at last the survivors betook themselves to
flight in every direction. The cavalry, in two divisions, were
sent in pursuit, and made great havoc. There were killed, of
the enemy, on that day, twenty-three thousand, and four thousand
seven hundred were taken, with more than five hundred
horses, and eighty-eight military ensigns. The victory was
great, but not obtained without loss of blood. There fell, of the
two Roman legions, a few more than two hundred men; of the
Latin confederates, eight hundred and thirty; and of foreign
auxiliaries, about two thousand four hundred. The pr&aelig;tor led
back his victorious troops to their tents: Acilius was ordered
to remain in the camp which he had taken. Next day the spoils
of the enemy were collected, and those whose bravery had been
remarkable were presented with gifts in a public assembly.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d33" name="d33"></a>33</span>
The wounded were then conveyed into the town of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1889" id="Page_1889">Pg 1889</a></span>
&AElig;bura, and the legions marched through Carpetania, against
Contrebia. The garrison there, on being invested, sent for
succours to the Celtiberians; but these were long in coming,
not because they were unwilling to give assistance, but that
after they had begun their march the roads were rendered
impassable, and the rivers swelled by continued rains, so that
their countrymen, despairing of assistance, capitulated. Flaccus
also, being compelled by the same severe weather, brought
his whole army into the city. The Celtiberians, who were
on their march, having heard nothing of the capitulation,
when the rains abated at last, passed the rivers, and came to
Contrebia. When they saw no camp before the town, supposing
either that it was removed to the other side, or
that the enemy had retired, they came up towards the walls
in careless disorder. The Romans made a sally against
them from two gates, and attacking them in confusion completely
routed them. The same circumstance that disabled
them from standing their ground and maintaining a fight,&mdash;their
not having come in one body, or in a regular disposition,
round their standards,&mdash;proved favourable to many in making
their escape: for they scattered themselves widely over the
whole plain, so that the Romans could no where enclose any
considerable body of them. However, there were about twelve
thousand killed, and more than five thousand taken, with four
hundred horses, and sixty-two military standards. The stragglers,
flying homewards, turned back another body of Celtiberians,
whom they met on the road, by informing them of
the surrender of Contrebia, and their own defeat; whereupon
they all immediately dispersed, and made the best of their way
to their several villages and forts. Flaccus, leaving Contrebia,
led his legions through Celtiberia ravaging the country;
he stormed many forts until at length the greatest part of the
Celtiberians surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d34" name="d34"></a>34</span>
Such were the transactions of that year in Hither
Spain. In the Farther province, Manlius fought several successful
battles with the Lusitanians. In the same year the
Latin colony of Aquileia was established in the Gallic territory.
Three thousand foot soldiers received each fifty acres,
centurions a hundred, horsemen a hundred and forty. The
three commissioners who conducted the settlement were Publius
Cornelius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius and Lucius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1890" id="Page_1890">Pg 1890</a></span>
Manlius Acidinus. Two temples were dedicated this year, one
to Venus Erycina, at the Colline gate; Lucius Porcius Licinius
duumvir, son of Lucius, dedicated it. This temple had been
vowed, during the Ligurian war, by Lucius Porcius, the consul
The other to Piety, in the herb-market. Manius Acilius Glabrio,
the duumvir, dedicated this temple; he erected a gilded
statue of his father Glabrio, the first of the kind that ever was
seen in Italy. This was the person who vowed the temple, on the
day whereon he gained the decisive victory over king Antiochus,
at Thermopyl&aelig;, and who, likewise, had contracted for
its being built, in pursuance of a decree of the senate. At
the same time when these temples were consecrated, Lucius
&AElig;milius Paullus, the proconsul, triumphed over the Ingaunian
Ligurians. He carried in the procession twenty-five golden
crowns, but no other article of either gold or silver. Many
Ligurian chiefs were led captives before his chariot, and he
distributed to each of his soldiers three hundred <i>asses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The
arrival of ambassadors from the Ligurians, begging that a
perpetual peace might be established, enhanced the reputation
of this triumph, and they asserted, that &#8220;the Ligurians had
come to a resolution never again to take arms, on any occasion,
except when commanded by the Roman people.&#8221; This answer
was given to the Ligurians, by Quintus Fabius, the prætor,
by order of the senate, that &#8220;such kind of language was not
new with the Ligurians; but it concerned chiefly their own
interest that their disposition should be new, and conformable
to their language. They must go to the consuls, and perform
whatever was commanded by them; for the senate would
never believe, from any other than the consuls, that the Ligurians
were really and sincerely disposed to peace.&#8221; Peace
however was made with that people. In Corsica, a battle
was fought against the inhabitants. The pr&aelig;tor, Marcus Pinarius,
slew in the field about two thousand of them; by
which loss they were compelled to give hostages, and a hundred
thousand pounds of wax. The army was then carried
over into Sardinia, and some successful battles were fought
against the Iliensians, a nation, even at the present day, not in
every particular friendly to us. In this year a hundred hostages
were restored to the Carthaginians, and the Roman people
enabled them to live in peace, not only among themselves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1891" id="Page_1891">Pg 1891</a></span>
but also with Masinissa, who at that time with an armed force
held possession of the land in dispute.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d35" name="d35"></a>35</span>
The consuls had nothing to do in their province. Marcus
B&aelig;bius, being summoned home to Rome to preside at the
elections, created consuls Aulus Postumius Albinus Luscus
and Caius Calpurnius Piso. Then Tiberius Sempronius
Gracchus, Lucius Postumius Albinus, Publius Cornelius Mammula
Titus Minucius Molliculus, Aulus Hostilius Mancinus,
and Caius M&aelig;nius were made pr&aelig;tors. All these entered
into office on the ides of March. In the beginning of this
year in which Aulus Postumius Albinus and Caius Calpurnius
Piso were consuls, Lucius Minucius, lieutenant-general,
and two military tribunes, Titus M&aelig;nius and Lucius Terentius
Massilicta, who had come from Hither Spain from Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus, were introduced to an audience of the
senate by Aulus Postumius the consul. These, after informing
the senate of the two victories gained, of the submission
of Celtiberia, and of the conclusion of the business of the province,
and that there was no occasion either to send pay, as
usual, or corn to the army for that year, requested, first, that
&#8220;on account of these successes a thanksgiving should be performed
to the immortal gods; and, then, that leave should be
given to Quintus Fulvius, on his quitting the province, to
bring home from it the army which had served under him and
many former pr&aelig;tors, with much bravery. They represented,
that this measure, besides the propriety of it, was in some
degree necessary, for the troops were so obstinately bent on
it, that it did not seem possible to keep them longer in the
province; but, if they were not disbanded, they would either
leave it without orders, or, if any one would attempt to detain
them by compulsion, would break out into a dangerous mutiny.&#8221;
The senate ordered, that Liguria should be the province
of both the consuls. The pr&aelig;tors then cast lots for
theirs. The city jurisdiction fell to Aulus Hostilius; the
foreign, to Titus Minucius; Sicily, to Publius Cornelius;
Sardinia, to Caius M&aelig;nius; Farther Spain, to Lucius Postumius;
and Hither Spain, to Tiberius Sempronius. As this
last was to succeed Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, and wished that
the province might not be stripped of the veteran troops, he
spoke thus: &#8220;Quintus Minucius, I demand of you, since you
assert, in your report, that your province is subdued, do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1892" id="Page_1892">Pg 1892</a></span>
think, that the Celtiberians will always faithfully observe the
treaty, so that the province may be kept in obedience without
an army? If you cannot give us any assurance of, or undertake
to answer for, the fidelity of the barbarians, but think
that, at all events, there must be an army maintained there,
I pray you, whether would you recommend to the senate to
send a reinforcement into Spain, in order that those soldiers
only who have served out their time may be discharged, and
the recruits mixed with the veterans? or to withdraw the
veteran legions, and enlist new ones, and send them in their
place? and this, although the contempt entertained for such
new recruits might rouse barbarians of more pacific tempers
to a renewal of war? would it be a matter easier said than
done, to reduce to complete subjection a province naturally
fierce, and constantly renewing the war? A few states, as I
am informed, who were awed, more than the rest, by the
nearness of our winter quarters, have submitted to our
authority and dominion, while those more remote are in arms.
This being the case, conscript fathers, I now give notice
beforehand, that, with the army at present there, I will undertake
to execute the business of the republic; but, if Flaccus
bring those legions home with him, I will choose some quiet
part of the country for winter quarters, and will not expose
raw soldiers to an enemy so remarkably ferocious.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d36" name="d36"></a>36</span>
To these questions, which he had been asked, the lieutenant-general
answered, that &#8220;neither he nor any other
could possibly divine what were the sentiments of the Celtiberians,
or what they would be in future; therefore he could
not deny that it would be proper to send an army among a
barbarous people, who, though reduced to a state of quiet,
were not yet sufficiently inured to subjection; but whether a
new army or a veteran one might be requisite, rested with
him to decide who could ascertain with what sincerity the
Celtiberians would observe the peace; and who, at the same
time, had assurance that the troops would remain quiet, if
kept longer in the province. If a conjecture were to be
formed of their intentions, either from their conversations
with each other, or from the expressions with which they
interrupted the general&#8217;s harangues, they had openly and
loudly declared, that they would either keep their commander
in the province, or come home with him to Italy.&#8221; This discussion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1893" id="Page_1893">Pg 1893</a></span>
between the pr&aelig;tor and the lieutenant-general, was
suspended by the consuls introducing other matters; for they
thought it right, that their own provinces might be adjusted
before they deliberated concerning the army of the pr&aelig;tor.
An army entirely new was decreed to the consuls: two Roman
legions to each, with their proportion of cavalry; and of
the Latin allies, the usual number of fifteen thousand foot and
eight hundred horse. With these forces, they were directed
to make war on the Apuan Ligurians. Publius Cornelius and
Marcus B&aelig;bius were continued in command, and ordered to
hold the government of the provinces until the consuls should
arrive. They were ordered then to disband their troops, and
return to Rome. Then they deliberated concerning the army
under Tiberius Sempronius. The consuls were ordered to
enlist for him a new legion of five thousand two hundred foot
and four hundred horse; and also a thousand Roman foot and
five hundred horse; and to command the allies of Latium to
furnish seven thousand foot and three hundred horse. With
this army it was determined that Sempronius should go
into Hither Spain. Permission was granted to Quintus
Fulvius, with respect to all those soldiers, whether Romans or
allies, who had been transported into Spain previous to the
consulate of Spurius Postumius and Quintus Marcius; and
likewise to such as, after the junction of the reinforcements,
should be found in the two legions, above the
number of ten thousand four hundred foot and six hundred
horse; and in the Latin auxiliaries above twelve thousand
foot and six hundred horse, who had behaved with courage
under Quintus Fulvius in the two battles with the Celtiberians,&mdash;these,
if he thought proper, he might bring
home. Thanksgivings were also decreed, because he had
managed the republic successfully; and the rest of the pr&aelig;tors
sent into their provinces. Quintus Fabius Buteo had his
command in Gaul. It was resolved that eight legions should
be employed this year, besides the veteran army then in
Liguria, which expected to be speedily disbanded; and that
very army was made up with difficulty, in consequence of the
pestilence which continued, for the third year, to depopulate
the city of Rome and all Italy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d37" name="d37"></a>37</span>
Tiberius Minucius, the pr&aelig;tor, died of this malady;
and soon after, Caius Calpurnius, the consul; also many illustrious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1894" id="Page_1894">Pg 1894</a></span>
men of all ranks; so that at last this calamity began to
be considered as a prodigy. Caius Servilius, chief pontiff
was ordered to find out proper atonements for the wrath of
the gods; the decemvirs to inspect the books, and the consul
to vow offerings, and to present gilded statues, to Apollo
&AElig;sculapius, and Health; which he vowed and gave. The
decemvirs proclaimed, on account of the sickness, a supplication
of two days in the city, and in all the market-towns
and villages; all persons above the age of twelve years
offered the supplication, with garlands on their heads, and
holding laurels in their hands. There had, also, crept into
people&#8217;s minds a suspicion of human villany in regard to it
whereupon Caius Claudius, the pr&aelig;tor, who had been substituted
in the room of Tiberius Minucius, was commissioned
by a decree of the senate, to make inquisition concerning acts of
poisoning committed in the city, or within ten miles of it; and
Caius M&aelig;nius was ordered to do the same, before he passed
over to his province, Sardinia, in the market-towns and
villages beyond the tenth stone. The death of the consul was
most suspected. It was reported that he had been murdered
by his wife, Quarta Hostilia; and when her son, Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus, was proclaimed consul in the room of his
stepfather, the death of Piso began to excite much more suspicion;
for witnesses appeared, who testified, that, after
Albinus and Piso were declared consuls, in which election
Flaccus had suffered a disappointment, his mother upbraided
him with being refused the consulship a third time, and then
desired him to make ready to stand candidate again, saying,
&#8220;she would take such measures that within two months he
should be made consul.&#8221; This expression verified by the
event, which was but too real, joined to many other evidences
of the same tendency, appeared such strong proof, that Hostilia
was condemned. In the spring of this year, the levies detained
the new consuls at Rome; while the death of one of
them, and the holding of the assembly to substitute another
in his place, occasioned still further delays. In the mean
time Publius Cornelius and Marcus B&aelig;bius, who, in their
consulate, had done nothing worth mention, led their troops
into the country of the Apuan Ligurians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d38" name="d38"></a>38</span>
The Ligurians, who did not expect an attack before the
arrival of the consuls in the province, were surprised, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1895" id="Page_1895">Pg 1895</a></span>
surrendered to the number of twelve thousand men. Cornelius
and B&aelig;bius, having consulted the senate by letter,
determined to bring them down from their mountains into a
plain country, so far from home, that they should have no
hope of a return; for they were convinced, that before this
was done no end could be put to the war in Liguria. There
was a tract of land in Samnium, the public property of the
Roman people, formerly occupied by the Taurasinians. When
they intended to transplant the Apuan Ligurians to this
country, they published an order, that this people should quit
the mountains, with their wives and children, and bring all
their effects along with them. The Ligurians made, by their
ambassadors, many humble supplications that they might not
be compelled to relinquish their native home, the soil in which
they were born, and the tombs of their forefathers. They
promised to give up their arms, and deliver hostages. After
they failed in all their solicitations, and were destitute of
strength for the maintenance of a war, they obeyed the order.
Forty thousand men, of free condition, with their women and
children, were transplanted at the expense of the public, and
a hundred and fifty thousand sesterces<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> were given them, to
provide necessaries for their new habitations. Cornelius and
B&aelig;bius, who removed them, were commissioned to divide and
apportion the lands; but, at their own request, the senate
appointed five other commissioners, by whose advice they
should act. When they had finished this business, and
brought home their veteran soldiers to Home, a triumph was
decreed them by the senate. These were the first who ever
triumphed without having fought an enemy. Hostages only
were led before their chariots; for there appeared not, in their
triumphs, either spoils to be carried, or prisoners to be led
captives, or money to be distributed to the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d39" name="d39"></a>39</span>
In the same year Fulvius Flaccus, the proconsul in
Spain, as his successor did not come to the province at the
usual time, having drawn out the troops from their winter
quarters, proceeded to lay waste the farther part of Celtiberia,
whose inhabitants had not come in to make submission. But
by this proceeding he rather provoked than terrified the
spirits of the barbarians; so that, having collected secretly a
body of forces, they beset the Manlian pass, through which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1896" id="Page_1896">Pg 1896</a></span>
they knew, with certainty, that the Roman army would march.
Gracchus had commissioned his colleague, Lucius Postumius
Albinus, who was going to the Farther Spain, to desire Quintus
Fulvius to bring his forces to Tarraco, where he intended
to discharge the veterans, to distribute the reinforcements
among the respective corps, and reorganize the entire army.
The day also was mentioned to Flaccus, and that not very distant,
on which his successor would arrive. When tidings of
this new arrangement had compelled Flaccus to drop the
business which he had undertaken, and to lead away the troops
in haste out of Celtiberia, the barbarians, unacquainted with
the reason, and supposing that he had discovered their revolt
and secret assembling of an army, and that he was retreating
through fear, beset the pass with the greater determination.
When the Roman army entered this defile, at the dawn of day,
immediately the enemy starting up attacked it at two sides at
once. And when Flaccus saw this, he put down the confusion
arising among the soldiers by giving orders through the centurions
that every man should keep his post, in the order of
march, and make ready his arms; then collecting the baggage
and beasts of burden, into one spot, partly by himself, partly by
the help of the lieutenants-general, and military tribunes, he
formed his troops as the time and place required, without any
confusion. He put them in mind, that they were to engage with
men &#8220;who had been twice reduced to submission; that guilt
and perfidy, not valour or courage, were their only accessions.
That these people had put it in their power to make their return
to their country which otherwise would have been ignoble,
glorious and splendid; for they would now carry home their
swords red from the slaughter, and spoils dropping blood.&#8221; The
time did not allow more to be said, as the enemy were rapidly
advancing upon them; the extremities of the wings were already
engaged, and quickly after the entire lines.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d40" name="d40"></a>40</span>
The battle was furious in every part, but the success
various. The two legions fought with extraordinary bravery,
nor were the two cohorts of the allies remiss; but the foreign
auxiliaries were hard pressed, by men armed like themselves,
and rather a better description of soldiers; nor were they
able to maintain their ground. The Celtiberians, as soon as
they perceived that, in a regular line, and in fair fighting,
they were no match for the legions, made a charge against them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1897" id="Page_1897">Pg 1897</a></span>
in the form of a wedge, in which sort of attack they excel so
much, that on whatever part they direct their assault they
cannot be withstood. On this occasion, too, the legions were
ordered, and the line was almost broken. When Flaccus
observed this disorder, he rode up to the legionary cavalry,
asking them, &#8220;Have we any support in you? Is the whole
army to be lost?&#8221; Whereupon they called to him from all
sides, to &#8220;tell them what he wished to be done; and that it
should be instantly attempted.&#8221; &#8220;Cavalry of the two legions,
double your troops,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and charge the wedge, which
is attacking our soldiers; you will make a more violent charge,
if you spur your horses without bridles against the foe. This
expedient is recorded to have been often employed by the
Roman cavalry with great advantage.&#8221; They obeyed his
orders, and taking off the bits of the bridle, they spurred in
full career through that body twice, forward and backward,
breaking their spears to pieces, and making great havoc of the
enemy. The Celtiberians, on this dispersion of their wedge,
on which had been their whole reliance, were quite dismayed,
and almost giving over the fight, looked about for ways to
escape. And now, when the allied horse saw this brilliant
exploit of the Roman cavalry, they were so inflamed by the
example of their bravery, that without waiting for orders, they
made a charge on the enemy, while they were in confusion.
Then truly all the Celtiberians scatter and fly, and the Roman
general, when he saw their backs, vowed a temple to Equestrian
Fortune, and games in honour of Jupiter supremely
good and great. The fugitives, dispersing, were pursued with
much slaughter, through the whole length of the pass. Seventeen
thousand of the enemy are recorded to have been killed
on this occasion, and more than four thousand taken, with
two hundred and seventy-seven military standards, and near
one thousand one hundred horses. The victorious army
pitched no camp on that day. This victory, however, was
not gained without loss; four hundred and seventy-two Roman
soldiers, one thousand and nineteen of the allies and
Latins, and besides these three thousand of the auxiliaries
perished. The victorious army, having thus reasserted their
former renown, finished their march to Tarraco. The pr&aelig;tor,
Tiberius Sempronius, who had arrived two days before,
came out to meet Fulvius on the road, and congratulated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1898" id="Page_1898">Pg 1898</a></span>
him on the important services which he had rendered to the
commonwealth. They then, with perfect unanimity, settled
what soldiers they should discharge, and what they should
retain; and Fulvius, embarking the disbanded soldiers in the
fleet, set sail for Rome, while Sempronius led the legions into
Celtiberia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d41" name="d41"></a>41</span>
Both the consuls led their armies into Liguria, but on
different sides. Postumius, with the first and third legions,
invested the mountains of Balista and Suismontium; and,
by securing the narrow passes leading thereto with guards,
cut off all supplies of provisions; and by want of every thing
he reduced them to an entire obedience. Fulvius, with the
second and fourth legions, marched from Pis&aelig; against the
Apuan Ligurians; and having received the submission of
that part of them which inhabited the banks of the river Macra,
he put them, to the number of seven thousand men, on board
ships, and sent them along the Etrurian coast to Neapolis,
from whence they were conducted into Samnium, and lands
were assigned to them among their countrymen. The vine-yards
of the Ligurians of the mountains were cut down and
their corn burnt by Aulus Postumius, until, compelled by all
the calamities of war, they surrendered and delivered up their
arms. From thence Postumius proceeded, by sea, to visit the
coast of the Ingaunian and Intemelian tribes. Before these
consuls joined the army which had been ordered to meet at
Pis&aelig;, Aulus Postumius, and a brother of Quintus Fulvius,
Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, had the command of it. Fulvius was
military tribune of the second legion. He in his months<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> of
command disbanded the legion, after obliging the centurions
to swear, that they would carry the money in their hands to
the treasury, and deliver it to the qu&aelig;stors. When this was
announced to Aulus at Placentia, to which place he happened
to have made an excursion, he set out with some light horsemen,
in quest of the disbanded men; and such as he could
overtake, he sharply rebuked and brought back to Pis&aelig;, and
then apprised the consul of the whole matter. When he laid
the business before the senate, a decree was passed that Marcus
Fulvius should be banished into that part of Spain beyond
New Carthage; and a letter was given him by the consul,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1899" id="Page_1899">Pg 1899</a></span>
to be carried into Farther Spain, to Publius Manlius. The
soldiers were ordered to return to their standards; and it
was decreed, that, as a mark of disgrace, that legion should,
for that year, receive but half a year&#8217;s pay. The consul
was likewise ordered to sell the person and property of every
soldier who should not return to the army.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d42" name="d42"></a>42</span>
In the same year Lucius Duronius, who had been pr&aelig;tor
the year before, returned with ten ships from Illyricum to Brundusium,
and leaving the fleet in that harbour, came to Rome, and
in giving a recital of the services which he had performed in
his province, he threw the blame of all the piracies committed
by sea, on Gentius, king of Illyricum, as their undoubted cause.
&#8220;From his kingdom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;came all the ships that had
ravaged the coast of the Hadriatic; that he had sent ambassadors
on the subject, but they were not even allowed an audience
of the king.&#8221; Some time before this, ambassadors had
come to Rome from Gentius, who said, that &#8220;when the Romans
came for the purpose of holding a conference with the
king, he happened to be sick in a remote part of his dominions;
and that Gentius requested of the senate, not to give credit to
the forged charges which his enemies had made against him.&#8221;
Duronius added, that injuries were offered to many Roman citizens
and Latin allies, in Gentius&#8217;s dominions; some of whom
he held in confinement in Corcyra. It was their pleasure
that all these should be brought to Rome; that the pr&aelig;tor,
Caius Claudius, should inquire into that business; and that
until this were done, no answer should be given to king Gentius,
or his ambassadors. Among many others whom the
pestilence of this year cut off, several priests also died. Lucius
Valerius Flaccus, a pontiff, died of it; and in his room
was substituted Quintus Fabius Labeo. Publius Manlius,
who had lately come home from the Farther Spain, and was
triumvir of religious feasts, died also; Quintus Fulvius, son
of Marcus, then a mere youth, succeeded him. The appointing
of a king of the sacrifices in the room of Cneius Cornelius
Dolabella, gave rise to a dispute between Caius Servilius,
chief pontiff, and Lucius Cornelius Dolabella, naval duumvir;
whom the pontiff ordered to resign his office, to the end that
he might inaugurate him; and on the duumvir&#8217;s refusing to
do this, a fine was therefore imposed on him by the pontiff;
and when the latter appealed, they contended about the affair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1900" id="Page_1900">Pg 1900</a></span>
before the people. After a majority of the tribes, being called
in, had ordered that the duumvir should comply with the
requisition of the pontiff, and that if he would resign his commission
the fine should be remitted, an unfavourable omen
from the heavens intervened, which broke off the proceedings
of the assembly. After this the pontiffs were prevented
by religious scruples from inaugurating Dolabella. They
consecrated Publius Cl&aelig;lius Siculus, who had been installed
in the second place. Towards the end of the year, Caius
Servilius Geminus, the chief pontiff, also died; the same was
decemvir of religious affairs. In his room, as pontiff, Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus was nominated by the college; but Marcus
&AElig;milius Lepidus, was elected chief pontiff, though many
illustrious men sought that office; and Quintus Marcius
Philippus was appointed to the office of the same, as decemvir
of religious affairs. Spurius Postumius Albinus, an augur,
died; and the augurs elected into his place Publius Scipio,
son of Africanus. On the request of the people of Cum&aelig;
that year, leave was granted them to use the Latin language
in their public business, and that their auctioneers should
have a right to use the Latin language in selling.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d43" name="d43"></a>43</span>
To the Pisans, offering ground for the establishment of
a Latin colony, thanks were returned by the senate, and triumvirs
were appointed to conduct that business; these were
Quintus Fabius Buteo, Marcus Pompilius L&aelig;nas, and Publius
Pompilius L&aelig;nas. A letter was brought from Caius M&aelig;nius,
the pr&aelig;tor, (to whom, after that the province of Sardinia had
fallen to his lot, orders were given to make inquisition concerning
sorceries, in places more than ten miles distant from
the city,) the purport of which was, &#8220;that he had already
passed sentence on three thousand people; and that still, in
consequence of fresh discoveries, the business of the inquisition
increased so much on his hands, that he must either
drop the prosecution of the inquiries, or give up the province.&#8221;
Quintus Fulvius Flaccus returned to Rome from Spain, with
a high reputation for his military exploits; and while he
waited without the city in expectation of a triumph, was
elected consul with Lucius Manlius Acidinus. And after a
few days, he rode through the city in triumph, accompanied
by the soldiers whom he had brought with him. He carried
in the procession a hundred and twenty-four golden crowns,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1901" id="Page_1901">Pg 1901</a></span>
together with thirty-one pounds&#8217; weight of gold, and of coined
Oscan silver a hundred and seventy-three thousand two
hundred pieces.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> He gave out of the booty to each of the
soldiers fifty denariuses; double that sum to a centurion; triple
it to a horseman; and the same sums to the Latin allies,
with double pay to all. This year, for the first time, a law was
proposed by Lucius Villius, plebeian tribune, ascertaining at
what ages men might sue for, and hold each office in the state.
Hence the surname Annalis was given to his family.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d44" name="d44"></a>44</span>
Four pr&aelig;tors were elected, after a lapse of many years,
by the B&aelig;bian law, which enacted that four should be elected
every alternate year; and the persons appointed were Cneius
Cornelius Scipio, Caius Valerius L&aelig;vinus, Quintus Mucius
Sc&aelig;vola, and Publius Mucius Sc&aelig;vola, sons of Quintus. To
the consuls, Quintus Fulvius and Lucius Manlius, was decreed
the same province as to the preceding ones, and the same
number of forces, infantry, cavalry, citizens, and allies. In
the two Spains, Tiberius Sempronius and Lucius Postumius
were continued in command, with the same armies which they
then had; and to recruit their numbers, the consuls were
ordered to enlist, of Romans three thousand foot and three
hundred horse, and of the Latin allies, five thousand foot and
four hundred horse. Publius Mucius Sc&aelig;vola obtained by
lot the city jurisdiction, and likewise the business of the
inquisitions concerning sorcery, in the city, and within ten
miles of it; Cneius Scipio, the foreign jurisdiction; Quintus
Mucius Sc&aelig;vola, Sicily; and Caius Valerius L&aelig;vinus, Sardinia.
The consul, Quintus Fulvius, before he meddled with
any of the public business, declared that &#8220;he intended to
acquit both himself and the state of the obligation of fulfilling
the vows which he had made; that on the day of his last
battle with the Celtiberians, he had vowed to perform games
in honour of Jupiter supremely good and great, and to build
a temple to Equestrian Fortune; and that by the Spaniards a
contribution of money had been made for these purposes.&#8221; A
vote was passed that the games should be performed, and that
duumvirs should be appointed to contract for the building of
the temple. With regard to the expenses, a limitation was
fixed, that &#8220;no greater sum should be expended on the games
than that which had been voted to Fulvius Nobilior, when he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1902" id="Page_1902">Pg 1902</a></span>
exhibited games on the conclusion of the &AElig;tolian war; and
that the consul should not, on account of these games, send
for, collect, or receive, or do any thing contrary to the decree of
the senate passed concerning games in the consulate of Lucius
&AElig;milius and Cneius B&aelig;bius.&#8221; The senate qualified their
vote in this manner, on account of the lavish expense occasioned
by the games of Tiberius Sempronius, the &aelig;dile, which
had been burthensome not only to Italy and the Latin allies,
but even to the provinces abroad.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d45" name="d45"></a>45</span>
The winter of that year was rendered severe by falls of
snow and storms of every kind; those kinds of trees which
are susceptible of injury from cold, were all blighted; and it
continued at that time somewhat longer than on other occasions.
Wherefore a tempest coming on suddenly, and with
intolerable violence, shortly after, interrupted the Latin festivals
on the mount; and they were celebrated afterwards,
pursuant to an order of the pontiffs. The same storm also
threw down many statues in the Capitol, disfigured very many
buildings by lightning, as the temple of Jupiter at Tarracina,
the white temple at Capua, and a Roman gate; and in some
places the battlements of the wall were overthrown. Among
the rest of these prodigies, an account was received from
Reate, that a three-footed mule had been foaled there. On
account of those portents, the decemvirs, having been ordered
to consult the books, declared to what gods, and with how
many victims, sacrifices should be performed; and that on
account of very many places being disfigured by lightning, a
supplication of one day should be performed at the temple of
Jupiter. Then the votive games of the consul Quintus Fulvius
were exhibited with great magnificence, during ten days.
Soon after was held the election of censors. Marcus &AElig;milius
Lepidus, chief pontiff, and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who had
triumphed over the &AElig;tolians, were chosen. Apparent hostilities
existed between these men, which were frequently displayed
in many violent disputes, both in the senate and in the
assemblies of the people. When the election was ended, the
censors, according to ancient custom, seated themselves in
curule chairs in the Campus Martius, near the altar of Mars;
whither in a few minutes came the principal senators, accompanied
by the body of the citizens, of whom Quintus C&aelig;cilius
Metellus spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d46" name="d46"></a>46</span>
&#8220;Censors, we are not unmindful that you have been
just now, by the whole body of the Roman people, set over
our morals; and that we ought to be admonished and ruled
by you, not you by us. Nevertheless, that should be pointed
out which in you may either give offence to all good men, or
at least what they would wish to be altered. When we look
at you separately, Marcus &AElig;milius, Marcus Fulvius, we
know not, in the whole state, any one person whom, if we
were called back again to vote, we could wish to be preferred
to you; but when we behold you both together, we cannot
avoid fearing that you are but ill associated; and that the
public may not reap as much advantage from your being exceedingly
pleasing to every one of us, as injury, from your
being displeasing one to another. You have for many years
past harboured an enmity, violent in its degree, and detrimental
to yourselves; and it is to be feared, that from this
day forward it may prove more detrimental to us and to the
state, than it has been to you. As to the reasons why we
fear this, many observations which might be made occur to
yourselves; had you not happened to be implacable they
would have engrossed your senses. These feuds we all
beseech you to terminate this day, in that sacred place, and
to suffer those whom the Roman people have united by their
suffrages, to be united by us, through this re-establishment
of friendship also. May you, with unanimity and harmony,
choose the senate, review the knights, hold the census, and
close the lustrum, as truly and sincerely as you would wish
that to happen which you express in the words, used in
almost all your prayers, &#8216;that this affair may prove good and
prosperous to me and my colleague:&#8217; and cause us men also
to believe that you really desire that which you entreat of the
gods. Titus Tatius and Romulus, after they had engaged in
battle as public enemies, in the midst of the forum of this city,
reigned there with unanimity. Not only quarrels, but wars,
are ended; and from deadly foes men frequently become faithful
allies, nay, sometimes, even fellow-citizens. The Albans,
after the demolition of Alba, were brought over to Rome: the
Latins, the Sabines, were admitted into the number of citizens.
It is a common saying, and, because founded in truth, has
become a proverb, that &#8216;friendships ought to be immortal,
but enmities mortal.&#8217;&#8221; A roar of approbation burst forth: and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1904" id="Page_1904">Pg 1904</a></span>
presently after, the voices of every one present, joining in the
same request, interrupted his speech. Then &AElig;milius, besides
other complaints, represented, that through Marcus Fulvius
he had been twice deprived of the consulship, which seemed
sure. On the other hand, Fulvius complained that he had
always been assailed by &AElig;milius, and that security had been
given for him, which was attended with great disgrace. Nevertheless,
each of them intimated that if the other would wish, he
was ready to submit to the direction of such a number of the
most respectable members of the state; and all present urgently
repeating their request, they mutually pledged their right
hands, and their honour, to dismiss in reality and forget all
animosity. Then the whole assembly expressing the highest
applause of their behaviour, they were escorted to the Capitol.
Both the attention paid to such a matter by the persons
of the first consequence, and the compliance of the censors,
were most warmly approved and commended by the senate.
The censors then demanded that a sum of money should be
assigned to them, which they might expend in public works;
and the customs of one year were accordingly decreed to them.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d47" name="d47"></a>47</span>
In the same year the propr&aelig;tors in Spain, Lucius Postumius
and Tiberius Sempronius, settled between them, that
Albinus should march through Lusitania, against the Vacc&aelig;ans,
and thence return into Celtiberia, and Gracchus penetrate
into the remotest parts of that province, if the commotions
there were more dangerous. First, having made an unexpected
assault on the city of Munda, by night, he took it by
storm; then, after having received hostages and placed a garrison,
he proceeded to attack their forts and ravage the country
with fire, until he arrived at another very strong city, (the
Celtiberians call it Certima,) there, when he was already
advancing his works, deputies came out from the town, whose
speech partook of all the simplicity of the earliest times, not
dissembling their wishes to continue the war, if they had
strength to support it.&mdash;For they requested permission to go
into the camp of the Celtiberians, and procure assistance from
them; and said, that &#8220;if they did not obtain it they would
then deliberate apart from them. By the permission of
Gracchus they went; and in a few days after brought with
them ten other ambassadors. It was mid-day. The first thing
that they asked of the pr&aelig;tor was, that he would order some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1905" id="Page_1905">Pg 1905</a></span>
drink to be given them. After drinking off the first caps,
they asked a second time, causing thereby loud laughter from
those present, at minds so unpolished, and ignorant of all
civilization. The eldest of them then says, &#8220;We have been
sent by our nation to ask, on what do you rely that you attack
us?&#8221; To this question Gracchus answered, that &#8220;he came
relying on an excellent army; which if they chose to see, in
order to carry back more certain information to their friends,
he would give them an opportunity;&#8221; and he orders the
military tribunes to draw up, in array, all the forces both
horse and foot, and make them go through their exercise in
arms. After this sight, the ambassadors, being dismissed,
deterred their people from attempting to succour the besieged
city. When the townsmen had from the towers raised fires,
(which was the signal agreed upon,) to no purpose, and had been
disappointed in their only hope of relief, they capitulated. A
contribution of two million four hundred thousand sesterces<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
was imposed on them; and they were ordered to furnish forty
horsemen of the highest rank among them, not under the denomination
of hostages, for they were ordered to serve as soldiers,
but in reality to be pledges for their fidelity.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d48" name="d48"></a>48</span>
From thence Gracchus now marched to the city of
Alce, where lay the camp of the Celtiberians, from which the
ambassadors had lately come. When he had harassed them
for some days with skirmishes, by sending his light troops
to charge their advanced guards, he made attacks more
important every day, in order to entice them all out of
their intrenchments. As soon as he perceived that his object
had been effected, he gives orders to the pr&aelig;fects of the
auxiliaries, that after a short contest they should suddenly
turn their backs, as if they were overpowered by numbers,
and fly with all haste to the camp: in the mean time he himself
drew up all his forces in order, within the rampart, at all
the gates. No long time had intervened, when he saw a body
of his own troops flying back, according to the preconcerted
plan, and the barbarians following in a disorderly pursuit.
He had his army drawn up within the trench in readiness for
this very opportunity. He therefore delayed only so long as
to allow his own men to retreat into the camp by a free
passage; then, raising the shout, he rushed forth from all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1906" id="Page_1906">Pg 1906</a></span>
gates at the same time. The enemy did not sustain the unexpected
shock. They who came to assault his camp could
not defend even their own. For they were instantly routed
put to flight, driven in a panic within their trenches; and at
last beaten out of them. On that day nine thousand of the
enemy were killed, and three hundred and twenty taken, with
a hundred and twelve horses and thirty-seven military ensigns.
Of the Roman army there fell a hundred and nine.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d49" name="d49"></a>49</span>
After this battle, Gracchus led the legions to ravage
Celtiberia. And when he was carrying and driving off all
things from every quarter, some states voluntarily, others
through fear, submitted to his yoke; within a few days he
received the submission of a hundred and three towns; he got
immense booty. He then marched back to Alce, whence he
came, and set about besieging that city. The townsmen
withstood the first assault of the enemy; as soon as they
found themselves attacked, not only by arms but by works
also, having despaired of any protection in the city, they all
retired to the citadel. And then at last they sent envoys,
and surrendered themselves, and every thing belonging to
them, to the Romans. Great plunder was obtained from this.
Many prisoners of distinction fell into his power, among whom
were two sons and a daughter of Thurrus. This chieftain,
who governed those tribes, was by far the most powerful of all
the Spaniards. On hearing the disasters of his countrymen he
sent persons to request protection for himself when coming to
the camp to Gracchus, and he came. And he first asked him,
&#8220;Whether the lives of himself and his subjects would be
spared?&#8221; When the pr&aelig;tor answered that they would; he
asked again, &#8220;Whether it would be allowed him to bear arms
on the side of the Romans?&#8221; To this too Gracchus assenting,
he said, &#8220;I will follow you then against my old allies, since
they have not thought proper to pay any regard to me.
From that time he united himself to the Romans, and by his
brave and faithful exertions he in many places advanced the
Roman interest.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d50" name="d50"></a>50</span>
After this, Ergavia, a celebrated and powerful city,
terrified by the disasters of the surrounding states, opened its
gates to the Romans. There are some writers who say, that
this submission of the towns was not made with sincerity;
that, from whatever district he might have led the legions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1907" id="Page_1907">Pg 1907</a></span>
hostilities were there renewed forthwith; and that he afterwards
fought, near Mount Caunus, a pitched battle with the
Celtiberians, from break of day to the sixth hour; that many
fell on both sides, and that the Romans did not perform any
feat from which you might believe that they were not vanquished,
excepting that, next day, they offered battle to the
enemy remaining in their intrenchments: that they employed
that whole day in collecting the spoils, on the third day they
fought again a more desperate battle, then there was no doubt
that the Celtiberians were at last completely defeated, and
their camp taken and plundered. Twenty-two thousand of
the enemy were killed on that day, more than three hundred
taken, and almost an equal number of horses, and seventy-two
military standards. This put an end to the war: the Celtiberians
concluded a sincere peace, and did not waver in their
allegiance as before. They say also, that during the same
summer Lucius Postumius fought twice with success in the
Farther Spain against the Vacc&aelig;ans, killed thirty-five thousand
of the enemy, and took their camp. It is however more
probable, that he came into the province too late to succeed
well in that summer.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d51" name="d51"></a>51</span>
The censors inspected the senate with sincere unanimity.
Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus, the censor, who was likewise
chief pontiff, was chosen head of the senate; three were
expelled from that body. Lepidus restored some who were
rejected by his colleague. They completed these works with
the money which had been assigned, and divided between them:&mdash;Lepidus
built a mole at Tarracina, an unpopular work, because
he had estates there, and brought into the account of the
public expenditure what ought to have been done at his own expense.
He contracted for the building of a theatre and stage near
the temple of Apollo, the whitening of the temple of Jupiter in
the Capitol, and the columns around it; he also removed from
those columns the statues that stood unseemingly before them,
and took down from them the shields and military ensigns of
all sorts hung thereon. Marcus Fulvius made contracts for
works more numerous and of more use; a haven on the Tiber,
and piers for a bridge across it; on which piers Publius Scipio
Africanus and Lucius Mummius, who were the censors, many
years after, bargained for the erection of arches; a court of justice
behind the new bankers&#8217; houses, and a fish-market surrounded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1908" id="Page_1908">Pg 1908</a></span>
with shops, which he sold to private persons; also a
forum and portico, on the outside of the gate Trigemina; another
portico behind the dock-yard, and one at the temple of
Hercules; also a temple of Apollo Medicus, behind that of Hope,
on the bank of the Tiber. They had besides, some of the money
undivided, and out of this they jointly agreed to pay for water
being brought, and arches being made; but Marcus Licinius
Crassus hindered this work, for he would not suffer it to be
brought through his grounds. They also established many
port duties and customs, and took care that very many public
chapels, which had been occupied by private individuals,
should be public and consecrated, and open to the people.
They likewise made an alteration in the mode of voting; for,
through all the regions, they divided the tribes<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> according to
the different ranks, conditions, and callings of men.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d52" name="d52"></a>52</span>
One of the censors, Marcus &AElig;milius, petitioned the
senate, that a sum of money should be voted for the celebration
of games, in honour of the dedication of the temples of Imperial
Juno and Diana, which he had vowed eight years before,
when employed in the Ligurian war. They accordingly voted
twenty thousand <i>asses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> He dedicated those temples each in
the Flaminian circus; and celebrated theatrical games for
three days after the dedication of the temple of Juno, and for
two after that of Diana, and each day in the circus. He also
dedicated a temple to the deities of the sea<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> in the field of Mars,
which Lucius &AElig;milius Regillus had vowed eleven years
before this, in a naval engagement against the commanders of
king Antiochus. Over the gate of the temple was hung up
a tablet with this inscription: &#8220;This temple was vowed by
Lucius &AElig;milius, the son of Marcus &AElig;milius, on coming forth
from a battle which he fought for the purpose of establishing
peace, in which he concluded a mighty war and subdued kings,&mdash;because
under his auspices, command, and successful generalship,
the fleet of king Antiochus, under the very eyes of
Antiochus himself and his entire army, cavalry and elephants,
was conquered, thrown into confusion, shattered, and put to
flight, on the eleventh day before the calends of January;
and there on that day thirteen ships of war with all their crews
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1909" id="Page_1909">Pg 1909</a></span>
taken. When that battle was fought, king Antiochus
and his dominions * * * * * * *.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
On this account he vowed a temple to the titular gods of the
sea.&#8221; In the same manner a tablet was placed over the gate
of the temple of Jupiter, on the Capitol.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d53" name="d53"></a>53</span>
Two days after the censors had inspected the senate,
the consul Quintus Fulvius marched against the Ligurians;
and having with his army crossed over pathless mountains
and woody valleys, he fought a pitched battle with the enemy,
and not only defeated them in the field, but took their camp
the same day. Three thousand two hundred of the enemy,
and all that tract of Liguria, surrendered. The consul
brought down all those who surrendered into the low-lands,
and posted guards on the mountains. His letters from that
province quickly reached Rome, and thanksgivings for three
days were voted on account of his successes. The pr&aelig;tors,
during these thanksgivings, celebrated divine worship by
sacrificing forty victims of the larger kind. By the other
consul, Lucius Manlius, nothing worth recording was done in
Liguria. Transalpine Gauls, to the number of three thousand,
coming over into Italy, without offering to commit hostilities
on any one, petitioned the consul and senate for some land,
that they might live as peaceable subjects, under the government
of the Roman people. But the senate ordered them to
quit Italy, and enjoined the consul Quintus Fulvius to search
after and punish those who had been the first to advise them
to cross the Alps.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d54" name="d54"></a>54</span>
This year died Philip, king of the Macedonians, being
worn out with old age, and grief occasioned by his son&#8217;s death.
He spent the winter at Demetrias, in great anguish of mind,
occasioned both by regret for his son and contrition for his
own cruelty. His other son also disquieted his mind, who,
both in his own opinion and that of others, was undoubtedly
king. The eyes of all were turned to him, and his own old
age was desolate. Some only waiting for his death, while
others did not even wait for that event. By which circumstance
he was still more distressed, and with him Antigonus,
son of Echecrates, named after his uncle Antigonus, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1910" id="Page_1910">Pg 1910</a></span>
been guardian to Philip, a man of royal dignity, and famed
also for a remarkable battle which he fought against Cleomenes
the Laced&aelig;monian. The Greeks called him the
Guardian, to distinguish him from the other princes of that
surname.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> His nephew Antigonus, of all the friends whom
Philip had honoured with his favours, alone remained uncorrupted;
and this faithful attachment to him had made
Perseus, who had been in no wise his friend, become now his
most inveterate enemy. He, foreseeing in his mind with
what danger to himself the inheritance of the kingdom would
fall to Demetrius, as soon as he perceived the king&#8217;s mind to
waver, and that he sometimes sighed with regret for the loss
of his son; at one time by listening, and at another by making
mention of the deed, as being rashly done, he himself was at
hand, adding his complaint to the frequent lamentations of the
king;&mdash;and, as the truth usually affords many traces of itself,
he assisted with the most zealous diligence, in order that the
whole might be brought to light as speedily as possible. Of
the agents employed in that business, those who were most
generally supposed guilty, were Apelles and Philocles, who had
gone ambassadors to Rome, and had brought the letter under
the name of Flamininus, which had proved so ruinous to
Demetrius. They generally murmured in the palace, that
it was a forgery, falsified by the secretary, and that the seal
was counterfeited.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d55" name="d55"></a>55</span>
But while this thing was rather a matter of suspicion
than of certainty, Antigonus accidentally met Xychus, whom
he seized and brought to the palace; then leaving him
in custody of guards, Antigonus went on to the apartment
of Philip, to whom he said, &#8220;I think I understood from
many conversations, that you would value it highly, if you
could ascertain the whole truth respecting your sons, which
of the two was assailed by the other&#8217;s deceit and secret machinations.
Xychus, the only man in the world who can unravel
this mystery, is now in your power. I met him by
accident, and I have brought him to the palace; order him
to be called into your presence.&#8221; On being brought in, he at
first denied; but with such irresolution, as showed that by a
slight application to his fears he would become a ready informer.
He did not withstand the sight of the executioner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1911" id="Page_1911">Pg 1911</a></span>
and the instruments of torture, but disclosed the whole process
of the villany of the ambassadors, and his own services
therein. Persons were instantly despatched to seize the ambassadors,
and they apprehended by surprise Philocles, who
was present, but Apelles, who had been sent in pursuit of a
person called Ch&aelig;rea, having heard of the information given by
Xychus, went over into Italy. With respect to Philocles, no
certain account has been published: some say, that for a time
he boldly denied all knowledge of the matter; but that when
Xychus was confronted with him, he persisted no longer;
others, that he even suffered the rack without confessing.
Philip&#8217;s grief was renewed and doubled; and he felt his unhappiness,
with regard to his children, press the heavier on
him, because one of them was not.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d56" name="d56"></a>56</span>
When Perseus was told that all was discovered, he was
too powerful to think that flight was necessary. He only took
care to keep out of the way, intending to guard himself, in the
mean time, during the remainder of Philip&#8217;s life, from the
flame, as it were, of his burning resentment; who, having
lost hopes of subjecting the person of Perseus to punishment,
meditated on this, as the last resource, that he would not, besides
impunity, enjoy the reward of his wickedness also. Therefore
he addresses himself to Antigonus, to whom he was obliged
for the discovery of the fratricide; and whom he supposed
the Macedonians, considering the fresh renown of his uncle
Antigonus, would neither be ashamed nor displeased at having
for their king. &#8220;Antigonus,&#8221; says he, &#8220;since I have
been brought into such a situation that the being childless, a
state which other parents reckon a curse, ought to be wished
for by me, I am resolved to transfer to you the kingdom which
I received from your uncle, and which his faithful and resolute
guardianship not only preserved for me, but even enlarged.
You are the only friend I have, whom I can judge worthy of
the throne; and, if I had not one such, I should wish it to
perish and become extinct, rather than be a prize to the
treacherous villany of Perseus. I shall think Demetrius recalled
from the dead, and restored to me, if I can leave you
substituted in his room, who alone have wept for his innocent
death, and for my unhappy error.&#8221; After this discourse he
did not fail to advance him by conferring on him honours of
every kind; and, as Perseus was absent in Thrace, he went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1912" id="Page_1912">Pg 1912</a></span>
round the cities of Macedon, and recommended Antigonus
to the chief men; and, had his life been prolonged, there is
no doubt but that he would have left him in possession of the
throne. After leaving Demetrias, he staid a very long time
at Thessalonica; and when he had gone thence to Amphipolis,
he was there seized with a severe sickness. Yet it was
evident that it was a disorder of the mind rather than of
the body, and that, owing to his anxieties and want of sleep,
for apparitions and phantoms of his innocent murdered son
ever and anon disquieted him, he breathed his last uttering
awful imprecations on the other. Nevertheless Antigonus
might have been first acquainted with the death of the king, had
it not been immediately divulged. Calligenes, the physician,
who had the charge of his treatment, not expecting the king&#8217;s
death, sent to Perseus, on the first appearance of desperate
symptoms, messengers who had been previously stationed at
different places; and till his arrival he concealed the death of
the king from all but those who were in the palace.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d57" name="d57"></a>57</span>
Perseus therefore surprised them all, when not expecting,
and totally ignorant of, his arrival, and seized on the throne,
which was obtained by wickedness. The demise of Philip happened
very seasonably for the purpose of gaining time and
collecting strength for the support of a war: for, in a few days
after, the nation of the Bastarnians, in consequence of long
solicitation, set out from their own abodes, with a large force of
infantry and cavalry, and crossed the Danube. Antigonus
and Cotto (the latter was a Bastarnian of distinction, and
Antigonus had been sent, much against his will, with this
same Cotto, as ambassador, to persuade his countrymen to
take arms) went forward, to carry intelligence of this to the
king; but at a small distance from Amphipolis a rumour,
and then authentic information, acquainted them with the
king&#8217;s death; which event disconcerted the whole arrangement
of their plan. It had been arranged in this manner;&mdash;Philip
was to procure for the Bastarnians a safe passage
through Thrace, and supplies of provisions. In order to be
able to effect this, he had courted the chieftains in that country
by presents, having pledged his faith that the Bastarnians
should march through it in a peaceable body. It was proposed
to exterminate the nation of the Dardanians, and to
establish settlements for the Bastarnians in their country:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1913" id="Page_1913">Pg 1913</a></span>
from which measure a double advantage would accrue, if both
the Dardanians, a nation ever hostile to Macedonia, and anxiously
looking to the unfortunate periods of its kings, would
be removed out of the way; and the Bastarnians, having left
their wives and children in Dardania, might be sent to ravage
Italy. That the road to the Adriatic Sea and Italy was through
the country of the Scordiscians, and that the army could not
be led by any other way; that the Scordiscians would readily
grant a passage to the Bastarnians, for they would have no
dislike to people resembling themselves in language and manners
and would probably join them in an expedition, when
they saw that they were on their way to the plunder of a
most opulent nation. The remaining plans were accommodated
to every kind of event that might take place; for if the Bastarnians
would be cut off by the Romans, still the removal
of the Dardanians, and the booty to be gained from the
remains of the former, and the full possession of Dardania,
would prove a consolation; or if they should be successful,
then, while the Romans would be employed in the Bastarnian
war, he might recover what he had lost in Greece. Such
had been the designs of Philip.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d58" name="d58"></a>58</span>
The Bastarnians commenced their march in a peaceable
array, relying on the word of Cotto and Antigonus. But, not
long after the report of Philip&#8217;s death, neither the Thracians
were easily dealt with, nor would the Bastarnians be content
with what they could purchase; nor could they be kept in a
body, so as not to go out of the road. In consequence, injuries
were committed on both sides; and, from the daily multiplication
of these, war at last burst forth. When at last the Thracians
were unable to withstand the great strength and numbers
of the enemy, having deserted their towns in the plains, they betook
themselves to a high mountain (they call it Donuca).
When the Bastarnians wished to come up, such a tempest there
discomfited them, when in vain approaching the summit of
the mountain, as, we are told, destroyed the Gauls, when plundering
Delphi. They were not only overwhelmed with a
deluge of rain, followed by prodigious thick showers of hail,
accompanied by tremendous noises in the sky, thunder, and
lightning which dazzled their sight; but the thunderbolts,
also, fell so frequently on all sides, that their bodies seemed to be
aimed at: and not only the soldiers, but their officers also,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1914" id="Page_1914">Pg 1914</a></span>
being struck by them, fell. When therefore, in hasty flight,
they, rushing on blindly, were scattered, and tumbling over very
high rocks, and the Thracians also attacked them when already
in dismay, they themselves then said, that the gods were the
cause of the flight, and that the sky was falling on them.
When, being dispersed by the storm, as by a shipwreck, they had
returned (most of them half armed) to the camp whence they
had set out, they then began to consider what they should do;
on which a disagreement ensued, some advising to return home,
and others to advance to Dardania. About thirty thousand men,
under the command of Clondicus, arrived at that place; the rest
marched back, by the same road through which they came, to
the country beyond the Danube. Perseus, having got possession
of the kingdom, ordered Antigonus to be put to death;
and, until he could settle his affairs on a firm foundation, sent
ambassadors to Rome, to renew the treaty concluded by his
father, and to request the senate to give him the title of king.
These were the transactions of that year in Macedon.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="d59" name="d59"></a>59</span>
One of the consuls, Quintus Fulvius, triumphed over
the Ligurians; which triumph, it was agreed, was granted
rather to the greatness of his influence, than to that of his exploits.
He carried in the procession a vast quantity of arms,
taken from the enemy, but no money; yet he distributed to each
soldier three hundred <i>asses</i>, double that sum to a centurion,
triple it to a horseman. There was nothing in this triumph
more remarkable, than that it happened to be celebrated on the
same day of the year on which he had triumphed, after his
pr&aelig;torship, the year before. After the triumph he proclaimed
the assembly of election, in which were chosen consuls, Marcus
Junius Brutus, and Aulus Manlius Vulso. Afterwards, a
storm interrupted the election of pr&aelig;tors, though three had
been already elected; but on the following day, the fourth
before the ides of March,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> the other three were elected, Marcus
Titinius Curvus, Tiberius Claudius Nero, and Titus
Fonteius Capito. The Roman games were renewed by the
curule &aelig;diles, Cneius Servilius C&aelig;pio, and Appius Claudius
Centho, on account of the prodigies which had occurred. In
the public forum, where a lectisternium was being celebrated,
there was an earthquake, and the heads of the gods who were
on the couches turned away their faces, and the cloak and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1915" id="Page_1915">Pg 1915</a></span>
robes placed on Jupiter fell off. It was also construed as a
prodigy, that the mice gnawed the olives on the table. For
the expiation of these, nothing more was done than repeating
the celebration of the games.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The sacred fire was extinguished in the temple of Vesta. Tiberius Sempronius
Gracchus conquered the Celtiberians and received their submission,
and built the town Gracchuris in Spain, as a memorial of his
exploits. The Vacc&aelig;ans and Lusitanians also were subdued by the proconsul
Postumius Albinus. Both generals triumphed. Antiochus, the
son of Antiochus, having been delivered to the Romans by his father, as
a hostage, on the death of his brother Seleucus, who had succeeded his
father on his demise, being sent from Rome to the sovereignty of Syria,
acted the part of a very worthless king, with the exception of his attention
to religion, owing to which he erected many magnificent temples in
various places; at Athens to Olympian, and at Antioch to Capitoline
Jupiter. The lustrum was closed by the censors. Two hundred and
sixty-three thousand two hundred and ninety-four citizens are said to
have been rated. Quintus Voconius Saxa, tribune of the people, proposed
a law, that no one should make a woman his heir. Marcus Cato
advocated the law: his speech is extant. This book contains besides the
successes against the Ligurians, Istrians, Sardinians, and Celtiberians,
and the commencement of the Macedonian war, which Perseus, the son of
Philip, was planning; for he had sent an embassy to the Carthaginians,
which had been heard by them at night; and besides he was tampering
with different states of Greece.</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote">1</span><i>The Roman people had now carried their victorious
arms over all parts of the world, and far and wide had penetrated
countries at a vast distance, and separated by several
seas. Nevertheless, in such a tide of success flowing according
to their wishes, having obtained a high character for moderation,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1916" id="Page_1916">Pg 1916</a></span>
<i>they were more powerful by their influence than by their
military sway; and they boasted frequently that they carried
more measures with foreign nations by policy, than by violence
and terror. Never insulting conquered nations and kings,
generous to their allies, seeking for themselves the honour of
victory only, to kings they had preserved their rank, to nations
their laws, rights, and liberty, whether in a treaty formed
with an equal or with an inferior; and although they had
so encompassed, by their arms, both coasts of the Mediterranean,
from Cadiz even as far as Syria, and had gained
respect for the Roman name through immense tracts of territory,
yet the only subjects they had, were the nations of Sicily
and the islands on the coast of Italy, and the tribes of the
greater part of Spain, which had not yet learned to bear their
yoke with resignation. It was the ill-timed treachery of their
enemies and rivals, rather than their own ambition, that
afforded them cause and material for the increase of their
sway. As a special instance: the cruelty of Perseus, who
obtained the kingdom of Macedon by treachery and crime,
displayed towards his subjects, detested by all, his frantic
avarice in the midst of boundless wealth, his inconsiderate
levity in the adoption and prosecution of his plans, both
destroyed him, and whatever could remain independent, as
long as he existed, the principal restraint on the Roman power;
for his fall recoiled upon others, and brought with it not only
the downfall of his neighbours, but also that of those who were
far removed from him. The fall of Carthage and of the
Ach&aelig;ans followed the ruin of the Macedonians: and when
the state of all was convulsed by their disasters, the rest of the
empires, already tottering for some time, were overthrown
shortly after, and all fell beneath the Roman sway. It was
my intention to lay here before the reader at a glance these
events, so intimately connected in interest, though occurring at
different times and places, whilst he contemplated the war
impending over the Romans from Perseus, from which especially
the Roman power drew the sources of its growth. Perseus
was then concocting that war in secret; the Ligurians and
Gauls provoked rather than employed the Roman arms.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote">2</span><i>Gaul and the Ligurians were the provinces assigned to the
consuls, Marcus Junius Brutus, Aulus Manlius Vulso: Gaul
was assigned to Manlius, Liguria to Junius. As to the pr&aelig;tors,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1917" id="Page_1917">Pg 1917</a></span>
<i>the city jurisdiction fell to Marcus Titinius Curvus; the
foreign, to Tiberius Claudius Nero; Sicily, to Publius &AElig;lius
Ligus; Sardinia, to Titus &AElig;butius; Hither Spain, to the
other Marcus Titinius, for there were two of that name
pr&aelig;tors in that year; and the Farther Spain, to Titus
Fonteius Capito. A fire broke out in the forum, by which
very many buildings were burnt to the ground, and the temple
of Venus was entirely consumed. The sacred fire of Vesta
was extinguished: the virgin who had the care of it was
punished with stripes, by order of Marcus &AElig;milius, the chief
pontiff, and supplication was performed, as usual in such
cases. In this year the lustrum was closed by Marcus
&AElig;milius Lepidus and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, censors, in
which were rated two hundred and seventy-three thousand
two hundred and forty-four citizens. The ambassadors of
Perseus arrived, requiring that he should be saluted by the
senate as king, ally, and friend, and that the treaty should be
renewed with him which had existed with his father Philip.
Perseus was an object of hatred and suspicion to the Romans,
and most of them had no doubt, that as soon as an opportunity
was presented, and his strength appeared to him adequate to
the struggle, he would wage against the Romans the war, prepared
in secret by Philip, for so many years. However, that
they might not appear to have provoked him when quiet and
desirous of peace, and to have themselves furnished him with
a cause for war, they conceded to him his demands. Perseus,
when this answer was received, supposing that the kingdom
was secured to him, began to acquire influence among the
Greeks. Being desirous therefore of procuring their friendship,
he recalled into Macedon all, without exception, who had
gone into exile, when condemned for debt or by any judicial
proceeding, and those who had left Macedon for high treason,
by edicts, openly announced in the island of Delos, and at
Delphi, and at the temple of Minerva at Itone, in which he
granted to those returning not only pardon, but also restoration
of all their property, with the income, from that period in
which each became an exile. He also remitted to those who
were living in Macedon whatever was due to the royal exchequer;
and released all those imprisoned for high treason.
When by these acts he had encouraged the minds of many, he
turned the attention of all Greece towards himself, and filled</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1918" id="Page_1918">Pg 1918</a></span>
<i>it with great hope. And besides, in the entire deportment of
the rest of his life, he preserved the dignity of a king; for his
mien was noble, and his person well fitted to discharge all the
duties of war and peace; and his age, now matured, possessed
a graceful majesty, beaming from brow and forehead. He
had none of his father&#8217;s wantonness, and licentious passions for
women and wine. By these praise-worthy acts Perseus rendered
the beginning of his reign agreeable, although it was destined
to have a termination very different from its commencement.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote">3</span><i>Before those pr&aelig;tors who had obtained by lot the Spains
could come to their provinces, great exploits were there performed
by Postumius and Gracchus. But the praise of
Gracchus was extraordinary, for he being in the prime of
life, since he far surpassed all his coevals in courage and
prudence, even then was lauded greatly by fame, and raised
greater hope of himself with regard to the future. Twenty
thousand Celtiberians were besieging Carabi, a city in alliance
with the Romans. Gracchus hastened to bear aid to
his allies. That anxiety tortured him, how he could signify
his intention to the besieged, while the enemy pressed the city
with so close a blockade, that it scarcely appeared possible that
an enemy could reach it. The daring of Cominius executed the
difficult task. He being pr&aelig;fect of a troop of horse, having previously
weighed over the matter with himself, and having informed
Gracchus of what he was preparing, dressed himself in a
Spanish military cloak, and mixed with the enemy&#8217;s foragers.
Having entered the camp with them he galloped from it to the city,
and announced the approach of Tiberius. The townsmen,
being aroused by this intelligence from the depth of despair to
cheerfulness and daring, and having determined to fight bravely
to the last, were relieved from blockade on the third day, in consequence
of the enemy having departed on the arrival of Gracchus.
He himself having been afterwards attacked by a stratagem
of the barbarians, by the union of skill and strength, so
repelled the danger, that the artifice recoiled on its originators.
There was a town, Complega by name, that had been built
several years before, but strengthened by fortifications and
increased by speedy additions, into which many of the Spaniards
had flocked, who previously straggled here and there in
need of territory. About twenty thousand men coming forth
from that city in the garb of suppliants, and holding forth</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1919" id="Page_1919">Pg 1919</a></span>
<i>branches of olive, stood in view of the camp as if entreating
peace. Immediately, having cast away the emblems of suppliants,
and having suddenly attacked the Romans, they fill
every place with alarm and consternation. Gracchus, by a
prudent counsel, deserted the camp under the pretence of
flight: and whilst they were plundering it with the usual
greediness of barbarians, and were encumbering themselves with
the spoil, he suddenly returned, and attacking them when in
no apprehensions of such an evil, slew the most of them, and
even made himself master of their town. There are some who
tell the story differently: that Gracchus, when he had discovered
that the enemy were distressed from want of food,
abandoned his camp, which was very well furnished with all
articles of food; that the enemy, having taken possession of it,
and having intemperately filled themselves with what they
had found, and gorged themselves to repletion, were suddenly
cut off by the return of the Roman army.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>But whether this is a different way of telling the same
exploit, or quite a different affair and different victory, it is
certain that Gracchus completely conquered several tribes,
and moreover the entire nation of the Celtiberians. I would
not however have the hardihood to assert that he took and
destroyed three hundred of their cities, although Polybius, a
writer of the highest authority, makes mention of it; unless
that under the name of cities we include towers and castles:
by which description of falsehood both the generals in wars
and the writers of histories take delight in setting off exploits.
For Spain, with its dry and uncultivated soil, could not support
a large number of cities. The wild and uncivilized
manners of the Spaniards, with the exception of those that
dwell on our sea, are also at variance with the assertion,
since the dispositions of men are accustomed to become more
mild by the meeting with fellow-citizens which occurs in towns.
But whatever we may determine concerning the number or
description of the cities taken by Sempronius, (for writers
vary also in the number, and some have related that one
hundred and fifty towns were taken by him, others that one
hundred and three was the number,) he certainly performed
noble achievements; nor was he distinguished by the praises
he received in war only; but he also proved himself unparalleled
in arranging and arbitrating peace and laws for the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1920" id="Page_1920">Pg 1920</a></span>
<i>conquered nations. For he distributed lands among the poor
and assigned them habitations, and by giving and receiving
an oath, secured to all the tribes inhabiting that country, laws
clearly defined, according to which they were to live in friendship
and alliance with the Roman people. And posterity often
appealed to the authority of this treaty in the wars which
afterwards broke out. Gracchus appointed that the town
which was hitherto called Illurcis, should be distinguished by
his own name, and called Gracchuris, as a monument of his
merit and actions. The report of the acts of Postumius is
more involved in obscurity. However the Vacc&aelig;ans and
Lusitanians were conquered by him, and forty thousand of
these nations were slain. These affairs being transacted, they
both, when they had delivered up the armies and provinces to
their successors on their arrival, went home to triumph. In
Gaul, Manlius the consul, to whom that province had fallen,
when material for a triumph was wanting, eagerly seized an
opportunity presented by fortune, of waging war against the
Istrians. They had aided the &AElig;tolians on a former occasion
when making war against the Romans, and lately too had
given trouble. At that time &AElig;pulo, a king of a violent disposition,
ruled them, who was said to have armed the nation
trained to peace by his father</i>, and therefore was much endeared
to the youth desirous of plundering.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e1" name="e1"></a>1</span>
When the consul held a council on the subject of a war
with Istria, some were of opinion that it ought to be begun
immediately, before the enemy could collect forces; others,
that the senate ought first to be consulted; the opinion was
adopted which opposed delay. Accordingly the consul, marching
from Aquileia, pitched his camp at the lake Timavus,
which lies very near the sea. Thither came Caius Furius,
one of the naval commanders, with ten ships; for two naval
commanders had been appointed against the fleet of the
Illyrians, and these commanders, with twenty ships for the protection
of the coast of the Hadriatic, were to make Ancona, as
it were, the pivot of their position; so that Lucius Cornelius
had to guard the coasts on the right, extending from the latter
place to Tarentum; and Caius Furius those on the left, as far
as Aquileia. This squadron was sent to the nearest port in the
Istrian territory, with a number of transports and a large
store of provisions; while the consul, following with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1921" id="Page_1921">Pg 1921</a></span>
legions, encamped at the distance of about five miles from the
coast. A plentiful market was soon established at the port,
and every thing conveyed thence to the camp. That this
might be done with greater safety, out-posts were fixed
around the camp; a newly-levied cohort of Placentines
was posted between the camp and the sea, as a picket in
the direction of Istria; and that the watering-parties might
likewise have protection at the river, orders were given
to Marcus &AElig;butius, military tribune, to take thither two
companies of the second legion. Titus and Caius &AElig;lius,
military tribunes, led out the third legion on the road towards
Aquileia, in support of those that went for food and forage.
In the same quarter, nearly a mile distant, was the camp of
the Gauls: Catmelus acted as their chieftain, and they were
not more than three thousand armed men.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e2" name="e2"></a>2</span>
When the Roman army first reached the lake Timavus,
the Istrians took post behind a hill, where they could not be
seen; and on its march thence followed it through by-ways,
watching attentively for some opportunity that might give
them an advantage; nor did any thing that was done, either
on land or sea, escape their observation. When they saw that
the advanced guards of the Romans were weak, and that the
market-place was filled with an unarmed crowd of persons
trafficking between the camp and the sea, and that they had
not fortified themselves either by works on land, or by the
help of ships, they made an assault on two of their posts at
once, that of the Placentine cohort, and that of the two companies
of the second legion. A morning fog concealed their
design; and when this began to disperse as the sun grew
warm, the light piercing through it in some degree, yet still
being far from clear, and, as usual in such cases, magnifying
the appearance of every thing, deceived the Romans, and
made the army of the enemy appear much greater to them
than it really was. And when the troops in both the posts,
terrified, had fled in the utmost confusion to the camp, there
they caused much greater alarm than that which they were
under themselves: for they could neither tell what made them
fly nor answer any question that was asked. Then a shouting
was heard at all the gates, since there were no guards at
them which could withstand an attack: and the crowding
together of the soldiers, who fell one against the other in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1922" id="Page_1922">Pg 1922</a></span>
dark, raised a doubt as to whether the enemy was within the
rampart. One only cry was heard, that of those urging to
the sea. This cry uttered by one, and without an objected
by chance, resounded every where throughout the entire
camp. At first, therefore, a few with their arms and a
greater part without them, as if they had received orders so
to do, ran off to the sea shore; then followed more, and at
length almost the whole of the army, and the consul himself,
when, having attempted in vain to call back the fugitives, he
had effected nothing by commands, advice, and, at last, by
entreaties. Marcus Licinius Strabo, a military tribune of the
third legion, with three companies alone, remained, being left
behind by his legion. The Istrians having made an attack
on the empty camp, after that no other had met them in arms
came upon him while he was drawing up and encouraging his
men at the general&#8217;s quarters; the fight was maintained with
more resolution than might be anticipated, from the small
number of the defenders; nor did it cease until the tribune, and
those who stood round him, were all slain. The enemy then,
tearing down the general&#8217;s tent, and seizing on all they could
find, went on to the qu&aelig;stor&#8217;s quarters, and the adjoining
forum, called Quintana. Thereupon, when they found all kinds
of food dressed and laid out in the qu&aelig;stor&#8217;s tent, and the
couches placed in order, their chieftain lay down and began
to feast. Presently all the rest, thinking no more of fighting
or of the enemy, did the same; and being unaccustomed to
any sort of rich food, they greedily gorged themselves with
meat and wine.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e3" name="e3"></a>3</span>
The appearance of affairs among the Romans was by no
means the same. There was confusion both on land and sea;
the mariners struck their tents, and hastily conveyed on
board the provisions which had been sent on shore; the
soldiers in a panic rushed into the boats, and even into the
water. Some of the seamen, in fear lest their vessels should
be overcrowded, opposed the entrance of the multitude, while
others pushed off from the shore into the deep. Hence arose
a dispute, and in a short time a fight, accompanied by wounds
and loss of lives, both of soldiers and seamen; until by order
of the consul, the fleet was removed to a distance from the
shore. He next set about separating the armed from the unarmed;
out of so large a number, there were scarcely found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1923" id="Page_1923">Pg 1923</a></span>
twelve hundred who had preserved their arms; very few
horsemen who had brought their horses with them; while the
rest were an ill-looking throng, like servants and sutlers, and
would certainly have fallen a prey, if the enemy had not neglected
the war. At length an express was despatched to call
in the third legion and the out-post of the Gauls; and at the
same time the troops began to march back from all parts in
order to retake the camp, and wipe off their disgrace. The
military tribunes of the third legion ordered their men to
throw away the forage and wood, and commanded the centurions
to mount two elderly soldiers on horses from which the
loads were thrown down, and each of the cavalry to take a
young foot soldier with him on his horse. He told them, &#8220;it
would be a great honour to their legion, if they should recover,
by bravery, the camp which had been lost by the cowardice
of the second; and that this might be easily effected, if the
barbarians were surprised while busied in plundering. In
like manner as they had taken it, so might it be retaken.&#8221;
His exhortation was received by the army with the utmost
alacrity; they eagerly bear on the standards, nor do the
soldiers delay the standard-bearers. However the consul, and
the troops which were led back from the shore, reached the
rampart first. Lucius Atius, first tribune of the second legion,
not only urged on his men, but informed them also, that &#8220;if
the Istrians meant to retain the camp, which they had taken,
by the same arms by which they took it, they would, in
the first place, have pursued their enemy driven from his
camp to the sea; and, in the next place, they would certainly
have stationed guards outside the rampart; and that it
was very likely that they were lying in sleep, or drowned
in wine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e4" name="e4"></a>4</span>
Immediately after this, he ordered his own standard-bearer,
Aulus B&aelig;culonius, a man of known bravery, to bear
in the standard; who replied, that if the men were willing to
follow him, he would cause it to be done more quickly.
Then, exerting all his strength, after throwing the standard
across the intrenchment, he was the first that entered the gate.
And on the other side, Titus &AElig;lius and Caius &AElig;lius, military
tribunes of the third legion, with their cavalry arrived; and,
quickly after them, the soldiers whom they had mounted in
pairs on the beasts of burden; also the consul with the main
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1924" id="Page_1924">Pg 1924</a></span>
body. Only a few of the Istrians, who had drunk in moderation,
betook themselves to flight: death succeeded as the
continuation of the sleep of the others; and the Romans recovered
all their effects unimpaired, except the victuals and
wine which had been consumed. The soldiers, too, who had
been left sick in the camp, when they saw their countrymen
within the trenches, snatched up arms, and committed great
slaughter. The bravery of Caius Popilius, a horseman, was
pre-eminent above that of all. His surname was Labellus.
He had been left behind in the camp, on account of a wound
in his foot, notwithstanding which he slew by far the greatest
number of the enemy. About eight thousand Istrians were
killed, but not one prisoner taken; for rage and indignation
had made the Romans regardless of booty. The king of the
Istrians, though drunk after his banquet, was hastily mounted
on a horse by his people, and effected his escape. Of the
conquerors there were lost two hundred and thirty-seven men;
more of whom fell in the fight in the morning, than in the retaking
of the camp.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e5" name="e5"></a>5</span>
It happened that Cneius and Lucius Cavillius, new
citizens of Aquileia, coming with a convoy of provisions, and
not knowing what had passed, were very near going into the
camp after it was taken by the Istrians. These men, when,
leaving their baggage, they had fled back to Aquileia, filled
all things with consternation and alarm, not only there, but,
in a few days after, at Rome also; to which intelligence
was brought, not only that the camp was taken, and that the
troops ran away, as was really the case, but that every thing
was lost and that the whole army was entirely cut off.
Wherefore, as is usual in a dangerous emergency, extraordinary
levies were ordered by proclamation, both in the city and
throughout all Italy. Two legions of Roman citizens were
raised, and ten thousand foot and five hundred horse were demanded
from the allies of the Latin nation. The consul
Marcus Junius was ordered to pass on into Gaul, and demand
from the several states of that province, whatever number of
troops each was able to supply. At the same time it was
decreed that Tiberius Claudius, the pr&aelig;tor, should issue orders
for the fourth legion, and five thousand foot and two hundred
and fifty horse, of the Latins, to assemble at Pis&aelig;; and that he
should guard that province during the consul&#8217;s absence; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1925" id="Page_1925">Pg 1925</a></span>
that Marcus Titinius, the pr&aelig;tor, should order the first legion,
and an equal number of allied foot and horse, to meet at
Ariminum. Nero, habited in general&#8217;s robes, set out for Pis&aelig;,
which was in his province. Titinius, after sending Caius Cassius,
military tribune, to Ariminum, to take the command of
the legion there, held a levy at Rome. The consul, Marcus Junius,
passed over from Liguria into the province of Gaul, and
having immediately ordered a levy of auxiliaries through the
states of Gaul, and having ordered the colonies to send soldiers,
came to Aquileia. There he learned that the army was safe;
wherefore, after despatching a letter to Rome, that they might
be no longer alarmed, he sent home the auxiliaries, which he
had ordered the Gauls to furnish, and proceeded himself to join
his colleague. There was great joy at Rome after the unexpected
news; the levies were stopped, the soldiers who had
taken the military oath were discharged, and the troops at Ariminum,
who were afflicted with a pestilential sickness, were remanded
home. The Istrians, when they with a numerous force
were encamped at no great distance from the consul, after they
heard that the other consul was arrived with a new army,
dispersed, and returned to their several states. The consuls led
back their legions into winter quarters at Aquileia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e6" name="e6"></a>6</span>
The alarm caused by the affairs of Istria being at length
composed, a decree of the senate was passed, that the consuls
should settle between themselves which of them should come
to Rome, to preside at the elections. When two plebeian
tribunes, Aulus Licinius Narva and Caius Papirius Turdus,
in their harangues to the people, uttered severe reflections on
Manlius, then abroad; and proposed the passing of an order,
that although the government of their provinces had already
been continued to the consuls for a year, yet Manlius should
not hold command beyond the ides of March; in order that
he might immediately, after going out of office, be brought to
trial. Against this proposition, Quintus &AElig;lius, another tribune,
protested; and, after violent struggles, prevailed so far,
as to prevent its being passed. About this time, when Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus and Lucius Postumius Albinus
came home from Spain, an audience of the senate is granted
to them, by Marcus Titinius the pr&aelig;tor, to speak of the
services which they had rendered, and demand the honours
they had merited, and also that thanksgiving should be offered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1926" id="Page_1926">Pg 1926</a></span>
to the immortal gods. At the same time also it was known
by the letters of Titus &AElig;butius the pr&aelig;tor, which his son
brought to the senate, that there was great commotion in
Sardinia. The Iliensians, having added to their forces Balearian
auxiliaries, had invaded the province though at peace
with them; nor could resistance be offered to them by a weak,
army, which had besides lost great numbers by a pestilence.
Ambassadors from the Sardinians made the same representations,
entreating the senate to send relief to their cities; for
as to the country, it was already entirely ruined. This
embassy, and every thing which referred to Sardinia, was referred
to the new magistrates. There was an embassy from
the Lycians, no less entitled to commiseration, who complained
of the cruel treatment which they suffered from the Rhodians,
to whose government they had been annexed by Lucius Cornelius
Scipio. &#8220;They had formerly,&#8221; they said, &#8220;been under
the dominion of Antiochus, and their bondage under that king,
compared to their present condition, appeared an honourable
state of liberty; that they were not only oppressed by acts of
government, but individually underwent real slavery. That
they themselves, their wives, and children, were abused alike
by them; that cruelties were practised on their persons, and
their character blotted and dishonoured, a circumstance which
would excite the indignation of every one. They were openly
treated with contemptuous insults, merely for the purpose of
exercising an usurped prerogative, that they might not doubt
that there was no difference between them and purchased
slaves.&#8221; The senate was highly displeased at such proceedings,
and gave the Lycians a letter to the Rhodians, acquainting
them, that &#8220;it was the will of the senate, that
neither the Lycians should be subjected to the Rhodians as
slaves, nor should any other men who were born free become
the slaves of any one; but that the Lycians should be under
the government, and, at the same time, the protection of the
Rhodians, in like manner as the allied states were subjected to
the Roman people.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e7" name="e7"></a>7</span>
Two triumphs for conquests in Spain were then successively
celebrated. First, Sempronius Gracchus triumphed over
the Celtiberians and their allies; next day, Lucius Postumius
triumphed over the Lusitanians, and the other Spaniards in
that quarter. Tiberius Gracchus carried in the procession forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1927" id="Page_1927">Pg 1927</a></span>
thousand pounds&#8217; weight of silver, Albinus twenty thousand.
They distributed to each of their soldiers twenty-five denariuses,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
double that sum to a centurion, triple it to a horseman;
the same sums to the allied troops as to the Roman. The consul,
Marcus Junius, happened to arrive at Rome at this time from
Istria, in order to hold the elections. The plebeian tribunes,
Papirius and Licinius, after harassing him in the senate, with
questions relative to what had passed in Istria, brought him
into the assembly of the people. To which inquiries the consul
answered, that &#8220;he had been not more than eleven days
in that province; and that as to what had happened when he
was not present, he, like themselves, gained his information
from report.&#8221; But they still proceeded to ask, &#8220;why, then,
did not Manlius rather come to Rome, that he might account
to the Roman people for his having quitted Gaul, the province
allotted to him, and gone into Istria? When had the senate
decreed a war with that nation? When had the people
ordered it? But he will say, &#8216;Though the war was indeed
undertaken by private authority, yet it was conducted with
prudence and courage.&#8217; On the contrary, it is impossible to
say, whether it was undertaken with greater injustice than
the rashness with which it was conducted. Two advanced
guards were surprised by the Istrians; a Roman camp was
taken, with whatever infantry and cavalry were in it; the
rest in disorder, without arms, and among the foremost the
consul himself, fled to the shore and the ships. But he should
answer for all these matters when he became a private citizen,
since he had been unwilling to do so while consul.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e8" name="e8"></a>8</span>
The elections were then held, in which Caius Claudius
Pulcher and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus were chosen consuls.
Next day the following persons were elected pr&aelig;ters,
Publius &AElig;lius Tubero, a second time, Caius Quintus Flamininus,
Caius Numisius, Lucius Mummius, Cneius Cornelius
Scipio, and Publius Valerius L&aelig;vinus. The city jurisdiction
fell, by lot, to Tubero; the foreign, to Quintus; Sicily, to Numisius;
and Sardinia, to Mummius; but this last, on account of
the importance of the war there, was made a consular province.
Gracchus obtains it by lot; Claudius, Istria; Scipio and L&aelig;vinus
received Gaul, which was divided into two provinces.
On the ides of March, the day when Sempronius and Claudius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1928" id="Page_1928">Pg 1928</a></span>assumed the administration, a cursory mention only was
of the provinces of Sardinia and of Istria, and of those who
had commenced hostilities there; but on the day following,
the ambassadors of the Sardinians, who had been referred to
the new magistrates, were introduced, and Lucius Minucius
Thermus, lieutenant-general under the consul Manlius in
Istria, attended; and by them the senate was accurately informed
how far these provinces were involved in war. Ambassadors
from the confederate states of Latium, who, after
having ineffectually applied to the former consuls and censors,
were at last introduced to an audience, made a powerful impression
on the senate. The amount of their complaints was
that &#8220;their citizens, having been rated in the general survey
at Rome, had most of them removed thither; and that if this
practice were allowed, it would come to pass, in the course of
a very few lustrums, that their deserted towns and country
would be unable to furnish any soldiers.&#8221; The Samnites and
the Pelignians also represented, that four thousand families
had emigrated to Fregell&aelig;; and that neither of these places
furnished less soldiers on that account. That there had been
practised two species of fraud in individuals changing their
citizenship: there was a law, which granted liberty to any of
the allies or Latins, who should not leave his offspring at
home, to be enrolled a citizen of Rome; yet, by an abuse of
this law, some did injury to the allies, others to the Roman
people. For, at first, to evade the leaving offspring at home,
they made over their children as slaves to some Roman, under
an agreement that they should be again set free, and thus
become citizens by emancipation; and then those men, who
had now no children to leave, became Roman citizens. Afterwards,
they neglected even these appearances of law; and,
without any regard either to the ordinances or to progeny,
passed indiscriminately into the Roman state by migration,
and getting themselves included in the survey. To prevent
such proceedings in future, the ambassadors requested the
senate to order the allies to return to their respective states,
and to provide by a law that no one should make any man
his property, or alienate such property for the purpose of a
change of citizenship; and that if any person should by such
means be made a citizen of Rome, he should not enjoy the
rights of a citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1929" id="Page_1929">Pg 1929</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e9" name="e9"></a>9</span>
The senate granted their petitions; and then Sardinia
and Istria, the provinces which were in arms, were disposed of.
Two legions were ordered to be enrolled for Sardinia, each containing
five thousand two hundred foot and three hundred
horse; and of allies and Latins, twelve thousand foot and six
hundred horse; and it was decided that the consul should have
ten ships, of five banks of oars, if he should think it requisite
to take them from the docks. The same numbers of infantry
and cavalry were decreed for Istria as for Sardinia. The consuls
were ordered to send into Spain to Marcus Titinius, one
legion, with three hundred horse and five thousand foot, and
two hundred and fifty horse of the allies. Before the consuls
cast lots for their provinces, several prodigies were reported:
that in the Crustumine territory, a stone fell from the sky into
the grove of Mars; that in the Roman territory, a boy was born
defective in his limbs; that a serpent with four feet had been
seen; that at Capua, many buildings in the forum were struck
by lightning; and, that at Puteoli, two ships were burned by
lightning. Amidst these prodigies which were reported from
abroad, a wolf also, after entering Rome by the Colline gate,
was chased during the day, and, to the great consternation of
its pursuers, escaped through the Esquiline gate. On account
of these prodigies, the consuls sacrificed victims of the larger
kinds, and there was a supplication, for one day, at all the
shrines. When the sacrifices were duly performed, they cast
lots for their provinces; Istria fell to Claudius, Sardinia to
Sempronius. Then Caius Claudius, by direction of the senate,
proposed a law and issued a proclamation, that &#8220;any of the
allies and Latin confederates, who themselves, or whose ancestors,
had been surveyed among the associated states of
Latium in the censorship of Marcus Claudius and Titus Quintius,
or at any time since, should all return, each to his respective
state, before the calends of November.&#8221; Inquiry
concerning such as did not obey, was intrusted to Lucius
Mummius the pr&aelig;tor. To the law and the proclamation of
the consul, was added a decree of the senate, that &#8220;the dictator,
consul, interrex, censor, or pr&aelig;tor, who then should be
in office, before whom any slave should be brought, to receive
manumission, should cause the said slave who was about to be
made free, to make oath, that the person giving him liberty did
not do it for the purpose of his changing his citizenship;&#8221; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1930" id="Page_1930">Pg 1930</a></span>
ordered that he, whoever would not swear this oath, should not
be manumitted. The cognizance and jurisdiction in this business
was, for the future, assigned to Caius Claudius the consul.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e10" name="e10"></a>10</span>
While these matters passed at Rome, Marcus Junius
and Aulus Manlius, the consuls of the preceding year, after
remaining during the winter at Aquileia, led their army early
in the spring into the Istrian territories; where when they
spread their depredations through a great part of the country,
grief and indignation, rather than any well-grounded hope of
being able to make head against these joint forces, roused the
Istrians, on perceiving the plunder of their property. A hasty
levy of their young men being made from all their cantons
this raw and tumultuary army made its first onset with more
vigour than perseverance. About four thousand of them were
slain in the field; and the rest, giving over the war, fled in
different directions to their respective states. Soon after,
they sent ambassadors to the Roman camp to sue for peace, and
then delivered up the hostages required of them. When these
transactions were made known at Rome, by letters from the
proconsul, Caius Claudius, the consul, fearing that this proceeding
might, perhaps, take the province and the army out
of his hands, without offering vows, without assuming the
military habit, and unaccompanied by his lictors, having acquainted
his colleague alone with his intention, set out in the
night, and with the utmost speed hastened to the province,
where he conducted himself even with less prudence than he had
shown in coming. For, in an assembly which he called, after
making severe remarks on Manlius&#8217;s running away from the
camp, which were very offensive to the ears of the soldiers,
as they themselves had begun the flight, and after railing at
Marcus Junius, as having made himself a sharer in the disgrace
of his colleague, he at last ordered both of them to quit
the province. And when they replied, that when the consul
should come, in the regular manner, agreeably to ancient practice;
when he should set out from the city, after offering
vows in the Capitol, attended by his lictors and dressed in
the military habit, then they would obey his orders. Maddened
by anger, he summoned the person who acted as
qu&aelig;stor to Manlius, and ordered him to bring fetters, threatening
to send Junius and Manlius to Rome in chains. The
consul&#8217;s command was slighted by this man too; and the surrounding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1931" id="Page_1931">Pg 1931</a></span>
crowd of soldiers, who favoured the cause of their
commanders, and were incensed against the consul, supplied
him with resolution to refuse obedience. At last the consul,
overpowered by the reproaches of individuals and the scoffs
of the multitude, for they even turned him into ridicule, went
back to Aquileia in the same ship in which he had come.
Thence he wrote to his colleague, desiring him to give
notice to that part of the new-raised troops who were enlisted
for Istria, to assemble at Aquileia, in order that he should
have no delay at Rome, but set out, in the military habit, as
soon as the ceremony of offering vows was finished. These
directions his colleague punctually executed, and an early day
was appointed for the assembling of the troops. Claudius almost
overtook his own letter. On his arrival he called an
assembly, that he might represent the conduct of Manlius and
Junius; and, staying only three days in Rome, he offered his
vows in the Capitol, put on the military habit, and, attended
by his lictors, set out to his province with the same rapid
speed which he had used in the former journey.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e11" name="e11"></a>11</span>
A few days before his arrival, Junius and Manlius had
laid vigorous siege to the town of Nesatium, in which the
principal Istrians, and Epulo their king, had shut themselves
up. Claudius, bringing thither the two new legions, dismissed
the old army, with its commanders; invested the town himself;
and prosecuted the siege with regular works. He by
the labour of many days changed the course of, and carried
away in a new channel, a river which flowed on the outside
of the wall, and greatly impeded the proceedings of
the besiegers, while it supplied the Istrians with water.
This event, of the water being cut off, terrified the barbarians,
as if effected by some supernatural power; yet
still they entertained no thoughts of peace, but set about killing
their wives and children; exhibiting a spectacle shocking
even to their enemies; and, after putting them to death in
open view on the walls, tumbled them down. Amid the simultaneous
shrieking of women and children, and this horrid
carnage, the soldiers, scaling the walls, effected an entrance
into the town. As soon as the king heard the uproar of the
captured city, from the cries of terror uttered by the flying
inhabitants, he plunged his sword into his breast, that
he might not be taken alive; the rest were either killed or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1932" id="Page_1932">Pg 1932</a></span>
taken prisoners. After this, two other towns, Mutila and
Faveria, were stormed and destroyed. The booty, which exceeded
expectation, considering the poverty of the nation, was
all given up to the soldiers. Five thousand six hundred and
thirty-two persons were sold by auction, and the fomenters of
the war were beaten with rods and beheaded. By the destruction
of these three towns, and the death of the king, the
whole country of Istria was brought to terms of peace; every
one of its states, giving hostages, submitted to the dominion of
the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e12" name="e12"></a>12</span>
For some time before, the conclusion of the war with
Istria, consultations were held among the Ligurians about the
renewal of hostilities. Tiberius Claudius, proconsul, who had
been consul the year before, with a garrison of one legion,
held the command of Pis&aelig;. And when the senate was informed
by his letter of their proceedings, they vote that &#8220;the
same letter should be carried to Caius Claudius,&#8221; for the other
consul had already crossed over into Sardinia; and they added
a decree, that, since the province of Istria was subdued, he
might, if he thought proper, lead his army into Liguria. At
the same time, a supplication for two days was decreed, in consequence
of the letter which he wrote concerning his actions in
Istria. The other consul, Sempronius, likewise was successful
in his operations in Sardinia. He carried his army into
the territory of the Ilian tribe of Sardinians. Powerful reinforcements
from the Balarians had come to the Ilians. He
fought a pitched battle against the combined forces of the two
states. The enemy were routed and put to flight, and driven
from their camp; twelve thousand armed men were slain.
Next day, the consul ordered their arms to be gathered into a
heap and burned, as an offering to Vulcan. He then led back
his victorious troops into winter quarters in the allied cities.
Caius Claudius, on receipt of the letter of Tiberius Claudius
and the decree of the senate, marched his legions out of Istria
into Liguria. The enemy, having advanced into the plains,
were encamped on the river Scultenna: here a pitched battle
was fought, in which fifteen thousand of the enemy were
killed, and about seven hundred captured in the fight, and
in the camp, for that too was stormed; and also fifty-one
military standards were taken. The Ligurians who survived
the slaughter, fled back in every direction into the mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1933" id="Page_1933">Pg 1933</a></span>
No appearance of arms any where met the consul while ravaging
the low country. Claudius, having thus in one year
subdued two nations, and, what has rarely been achieved in a
single consulate, completed the reduction of two provinces,
came home to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e13" name="e13"></a>13</span>
Several prodigies were reported this year: that at
Crustuminum a bird, which they call the ospray, cut a sacred
stone with its beak; that a cow spoke in Campania; that at
Syracuse a brazen statue of a cow was mounted by a farmer&#8217;s
bull which had strayed from the herd. A supplication of
one day was performed in Crustuminum, on the spot; the cow
at Campania was ordered to be maintained at the public
expense, and the prodigy at Syracuse was expiated, the deities
to whom supplications should be offered, being declared by
the aruspices. This year died, in the office of pontiff, Marcus
Claudius Marcellus, who had been consul and censor; and
his son, Marcus Marcellus, was chosen into the vacant place.
The same year a colony of two thousand Roman citizens was
settled at Luca. The triumvirs, Publius &AElig;lius, Lucius
Egilius, and Cneius Sicinius, planted it. Fifty-one acres
and a half of land were given to each. This land had been
taken from the Ligurians, and had been the property of the
Etrurians, before it fell into their possession. Caius Claudius,
the consul, arrived at the city, and after laying before the
senate a detail of his successful services in Istria and Liguria,
a triumph was decreed to him on demanding it. He triumphed,
in office, over the two nations at once. In this procession he
carried three hundred and seven thousand denariuses,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> and
eighty-five thousand seven hundred and two quinariuses.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
To each soldier fifteen denariuses<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> were given, double that sum
to a centurion, triple it to a horseman. The allied soldiers
received less, by half, than the native troops, for which reason
they followed his chariot in silence to show their disgust.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e14" name="e14"></a>14</span>
While this triumph over the Ligurians was celebrated,
that people, perceiving that not only the consular army returned
to Rome, but also that the legion at Pis&aelig; had been
disbanded by Tiberius Claudius, shaking off their fears, and
collecting an army secretly, crossed the mountains by winding
paths, and came down into the plains, and after ravaging the
lands of Mutina, by a sudden assault they gained possession
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1934" id="Page_1934">Pg 1934</a></span>of the colony itself. When this account was brought to
Rome, the senate ordered Caius Claudius, the consul, to hold
the elections as soon as possible, and (after appointing magistrates
for the ensuing year) to go back to his province, and
rescue the colony out of the hands of the enemy. The elections
were held as the senate had directed; and Cneius Cornelius
Scipio Hispalus, with Quintus Petillius Spurinus, were chosen
consuls. Then Marcus Popillius L&aelig;nas, Publius Licinius
Crassus, Marcus Cornelius Scipio, Lucius Papirius Maso, Marcus
Aburius, and Lucius Aquilius Gallus, were elected pr&aelig;tors.
To Caius Claudius, the consul, his command was prolonged for
a year, and likewise the administration of the province of
Gaul; and he was ordered, lest the Istrians should follow
the example of the Ligurians, to send into Istria the
allied Latin troops, which he had brought home to attend
his triumph. When the consuls, Cneius Cornelius and
Quintus Petillius, on the day of entering into office, according
to custom, sacrificed each an ox to Jupiter, the head
of the liver was not found in the victim sacrificed by Petillius;
which being reported to the senate, he was ordered to
sacrifice oxen until the omens should be favourable. The
senate being then consulted concerning the provinces, decreed
Pis&aelig; and Liguria to be the provinces of the consuls. They
ordered that he to whose lot Pis&aelig; fell, should, at the time of
the elections, come home to preside at them; and that they
should severally enlist two new legions and three hundred
horse; and should order the allies, and Latin confederates, to
furnish ten thousand foot and six hundred horse to each.
The command was prolonged to Tiberius Claudius, until
such time as the consul should arrive in the province.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e15" name="e15"></a>15</span>
While the senate was employed in these affairs, Caius
Cornelius, being called by a beadle, went out of the senate-house;
and, after a short time, returned with a troubled
countenance, and told the conscript fathers that the liver of a
fat ox, which he had sacrificed, had melted away; that, when
this was told him by the person who dressed the victims,
he did not believe it, and he himself ordered the water to be
poured out of the vessel in which the entrails were boiled;
and he saw all entire but the liver, which had been unaccountably
consumed. While the fathers were under much terror
on account of this prodigy, their alarm was augmented by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1935" id="Page_1935">Pg 1935</a></span>
the other consul, who informed them that, on account of the
first victim having wanted the head of the liver, he had sacrificed
three oxen, and had not yet found favourable omens.
The senate ordered him to continue sacrificing the larger
victims until he should find favourable omens. They say
that the victims offered to the other deities at length presented
good omens; but that in those offered to Health, Petillius
could find none such. Then the consuls and pr&aelig;tors cast lots
for their provinces, when Pis&aelig; fell to Cneius Cornelius; Liguria,
to Petillius. Of the pr&aelig;tors, Lucius Papirius Maso
obtained the city jurisdiction; Marcus Abutius, the foreign;
Marcus Cornelius Scipio Maluginensis, the Farther Spain;
Lucius Aquilius Gallus, Sicily. Two of them petitioned to
be excused from going into their provinces. First, Marcus Popillius
requested that he might not be obliged to go to Sardinia,
alleging that &#8220;Gracchus was bringing that province into a
state of tranquillity; that Titus &AElig;butius the pr&aelig;ter had been
given to him by the senate as his assistant; and that it was
by no means expedient to interrupt the train of business, for
the completion of which there was no method so efficacious as
the continuing the management in the same hands; that, amid
the transfer of command and initiation of the successors, who
must be impressed with a knowledge of circumstances before
they can proceed to action, opportunities of successfully transacting
matters were frequently lost.&#8221; The excuse of Popillius
was admitted. Then Publius Licinius Crassus alleged that
he was prevented from going into his province by solemn
sacrifices. That which had fallen to his lot was Hither
Spain. But he was ordered either to proceed thither, or to
swear in the public assembly that he was hindered by the
performance of solemn anniversary sacrifices. When this
determination was made in the case of Publius Licinius, Marcus
Cornelius demanded that his oath, of the like import,
might be admitted as an excuse for his not going into the
Farther Spain. Both the pr&aelig;tors accordingly took an oath in
the same words. Marcus Titinius and Titus Fonteius, proconsuls,
were ordered to remain in Spain, with authority as
before; and it was decreed that a reinforcement should be sent
to them of three thousand Roman foot, with two hundred
horse; and five hundred Latin foot, with three hundred
horse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1936" id="Page_1936">Pg 1936</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e16" name="e16"></a>16</span>
The Latin festival was celebrated on the third day
before the nones of May;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> and because, on the offering of one
of the victims, the magistrate of Lanuvium had not prayed for
the <span class="smcap">Roman people, the Quirites</span>, religious scruples were felt.
When the matter was laid before the senate, and they referred
it to the college of pontiffs, the latter determined that the
Latin festival had not been duly performed, and must be repeated;
and that the Lanuvians, on whose account they were
repeated, should furnish the victims. Besides the concern
excited by matters of a religious nature, another incident
caused no small degree of uneasiness. The consul Cneius
Cornelius, as he was returning from the Alban mount, fell
down. And being paralysed in part of his limbs, set out for
the waters of Cum&aelig;, where, his disorder still increasing, he
died. His body was conveyed to Rome to be buried, and the
funeral obsequies were performed with great magnificence:
he was likewise a pontiff. The other consul, Quintus Petillius,
was ordered to hold an assembly, as soon as the auspices
could be taken, for the election of a consul in the room of his
late colleague, and to proclaim the Latin festival. Accordingly,
by proclamation, he fixed the election for the third day
before the nones of August,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and the Latin festival for the
third before the ides of the same month.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> While the minds
of the people were full of religious fears, to add thereto,
several prodigies were reported to have happened; that a
blazing torch was seen in the sky at Tusculum; that the
temple of Apollo, and many private buildings at Gabii, and
a wall and gate at Gravisc&aelig;, were struck by lightning. The
senate ordered these to be expiated as the pontiffs should direct.
While the consuls were detained, at first by religious
ceremonies, and afterwards, one of them, by the death of the
other, and then by the election and the repetition of the Latin
festival, in the mean time Caius Claudius marched the army
to Mutina, which the Ligurians had taken the year before.
Before three days had elapsed from the commencement of the
siege he retook it, and delivered it back to the colonists; on
this occasion eight thousand Ligurians were killed within the
walls. He immediately despatched a letter to Rome, in which
he not only represented this success, but likewise boasted
that through his good conduct and good fortune there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1937" id="Page_1937">Pg 1937</a></span>not one enemy of the Roman people left on this side the Alps;
and that a large tract of land had been taken, which might be
distributed among many thousand men, giving each a share.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e17" name="e17"></a>17</span>
During the same period, Tiberius Sempronius, after
gaining many victories, totally subdued the people of Sardinia.
Fifteen thousand of the enemy were slain. All the tribes of
the Sardinians, who had revolted, were brought under the
dominion of Rome. On those which had formerly been tributary,
double taxes were, imposed and levied; the rest paid
a contribution in corn. When he had thus restored peace in
the province, and received hostages from all parts of the
island, to the number of two hundred and thirty, deputies are
sent by him to Rome, to give information of these transactions,
and to request of the senate, that in consideration of
those services, performed under the conduct and auspices of
Tiberius Sempronius, a thanksgiving might be offered to the
immortal gods, and permission granted him to quit the province
and bring home the army with him. The senate, having
given audience to the deputies in the temple of Apollo, ordered
a thanksgiving for two days, and that the consuls should
sacrifice forty victims of the larger kinds; but commanded
the proconsul, Tiberius Sempronius, and his army, to continue
in the province for the year. Then the election for
filling the vacant place of a consul, which had been fixed by
proclamation for the third day before the nones of August,
was finished in one day, and the consul Quintus Petillius declared
Caius Valerius L&aelig;vinus duly elected his colleague,
who was to assume immediately the administration of his
office. This man, having been long ambitious of the government
of a province, when, very seasonably for the gratification
of his wishes, a letter now arrived with intelligence that
the Ligurians were again in arms, on the nones of August<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
assumed the military habit; and ordered that, on account
of this alarm, the third legion should march into Gaul, and
join Caius Claudius, proconsul, and that the commanders of
the fleet should sail with their ships to Pis&aelig;, and coast along
the Ligurian shore, to terrify that people by the sight of a
naval power also. The other consul, Quintus Petillius, had
appointed a day for his troops to assemble in the same place.
Besides, Caius Claudius, proconsul, on hearing of the rebellion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1938" id="Page_1938">Pg 1938</a></span>in Liguria, having hastily collected some soldiers, in addition
to those whom he had with him at Parma, brought this army
to the frontiers of Liguria.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e18" name="e18"></a>18</span>
On the approach of Caius Claudius, the enemy, reflecting
that this was the same commander who had defeated them
at the river Scultenna, resolving to rely on situation, rather
than arms, for their defence against a force with which they
had so unsuccessfully struggled, took post in two mountains,
called Letum and Balista; and, for greater security,
surrounded their encampment with a wall. Some, who
were too slow in removing from the low grounds, were surprised
and put to the sword,&mdash;one thousand five hundred in
number. The others kept themselves close on the mountains;
and retaining, in the midst of their fears, their native savage
disposition, vented their fury on the prey taken at Mutina.
They put their prisoners to death after shocking mutilation:
the cattle they butchered in the temples, rather than decently
sacrificed: and then (satiated with the destruction of living
creatures) they turned their fury against things inanimate,
dashing against the walls even vessels made for use rather
than for show. Quintus Petillius, the consul, fearing that the
war might be brought to a conclusion before he arrived in the
province, wrote to Caius Claudius to bring the army into
Gaul, saying, that he would wait for him at the Long Plains.
Claudius, immediately on receipt of the letter, marched out of
Liguria, and gave up the command of the army to the consul
at the Long Plains. To the same place came, in a few days
after, the other consul, Caius Valerius. There having divided
their forces before they separated, they both together performed
a purification of the troops. They then cast lots for their
respective routes, it having been resolved that they should not
assail the enemy on the same side. It was certain that Valerius
cast his lot auspiciously, because he was in the consecrated
ground; the augurs afterwards announced that there was this
defect in the case of Petillius, that he himself when outside the
consecrated ground cast his lot into the urn, which was subsequently
brought into the sacred place. They then began
their march in different directions; Petillius pitched his camp
against the ridge of Balista and Letum, which joined the two
together with one continued range. They report, that while
he was here encouraging his soldiers, whom he had assembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1939" id="Page_1939">Pg 1939</a></span>
for the purpose, without reflecting on the ambiguity of the
word, he uttered this ominous expression: &#8220;This day I will
have Letum.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> He made his troops march up the mountain
in two places at the same time. The division in which he
was advanced briskly: the other was repulsed by the enemy;
and the consul riding up thither, to remedy the disorder, rallied
his troops; but whilst he moves about too carelessly in the
front, he was pierced through with a javelin, and fell. The
commanders of the enemy did not know that he was killed;
and the few of his own party who saw the disaster, carefully
covered the body from view, knowing that the victory rested
on this. The rest of the troops, horse and foot, though deprived
of their leader, dislodged the enemy, and took possession
of the mountains. Five thousand of the Ligurians were
slain and of the Roman army only fifty-two were lost. Besides
this evident completion of the unhappy omen, the keeper
of the chickens was heard to say, that there had been a defect
in the auspices, and that the consul was not ignorant of it.
Caius Valerius, <i>when he was informed of the death of Quintus
Petillius, made the army, thus bereft of its commander, join
his own; then, attacking the enemy again, in their blood he
offered a noble sacrifice to the shade of his departed colleague.
He had the honour of a triumph over the Ligurians.
The legion, at whose head the consul was killed, was severely
punished by the senate. They determined that the campaign
of this year should not be counted to the entire legion, and
that their pay should be stopped, for not exposing themselves
to the enemy&#8217;s weapons in defence of their commander.
About this time ambassadors came to Rome from the Dardanians,
who mere greatly distressed by the numerous army
of Bastarnians, under Clondicus, mentioned above. These
ambassadors, after describing the vast multitude of the
Bastarnians, their tall and huge bodies, and their daring
intrepidity in facing danger, added, that there was an alliance
between them and Perseus, and that the Dardanians
were really more afraid of him than even of the Bastarnians;
and therefore begged of the senate that assistance should be
sent them. The senate thereupon agreed, that ambassadors
should be sent to examine into the affairs of Macedonia;
and immediately a commission was given to Aulus Postumius</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1940" id="Page_1940">Pg 1940</a></span>
<i>to go thither. They gave to him as colleagues some
young men, that he might have the principal direction and
management of the embassy. The senate then took into
consideration the election of magistrates for the ensuing
year, on which subject there was a long debate: for</i>
people skilled in the rules of religion and politics affirmed, that,
as the regular consuls of the year had died, one by the sword,
the other by sickness, the substituted consuls could not with
propriety hold the elections. <i>An interregnum, therefore,
took place, and the interrex elected consuls Publius Mucius
Sc&aelig;vola, and Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus, a second time
Then Caius Popillius L&aelig;nas, Titus Annius Luscus, Caius
Memmius Gallus, Caius Cluvius Saxula, Servius Cornelius
Sulla, and Appius Claudius Centho, were chosen
pr&aelig;tors. The provinces assigned to the consuls were Gaul
and Liguria. Of the pr&aelig;tors, Cornelius Sulla obtained
Sardinia, Claudius Centho gained Hither Spain. There is
no record of those to whom the other pr&aelig;torian provinces
fell. This year was notorious for an epidemic, which however
attacked cattle only. The Ligurians, a nation ever
vanquished, yet ever rebelling, ravaged the lands of Luna
and Pis&aelig;; and at the same time there were alarming rumours
of disturbances in Gaul. Lepidus having easily
quelled the commotions among the Gauls, then marched into
Liguria. Several states of this country submitted themselves
to his disposal; and he, supposing that they were rendered
savage by the rugged mountain tops which they inhabited,
as the dispositions of the inhabitants of a country generally
resemble its natural features, by the precedent of some former
consuls, brought them</i> down to the plains. Of these the Garulians,
Lapicinians, and Hercatians had lived on the other
side of the Apennine, and the Briniatians on the farther
side.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e19" name="e19"></a>19</span>
On the hither side of the river Audena, Quintus Mucius
made war on those who had wasted the lands of Luna and
Pis&aelig;: and having reduced them all to subjection, he took away
their arms from them. On account of these services, performed
under the conduct and auspices of the two consuls, the
senate voted a thanksgiving for three days, and sacrifices of
forty victims. The commotions which broke out in Gaul and
Liguria, at the beginning of this year, were thus speedily suppressed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1941" id="Page_1941">Pg 1941</a></span>
without any great difficulty; but the apprehensions of
the public, respecting a war with Macedon, still continued.
For Perseus laboured to embroil the Bastarnians with the
Dardanians; and the ambassadors, sent to examine into the
state of affairs in Macedon, returned to Rome, and brought
certain information that hostilities had commenced in Dardania.
At the same time came envoys from king Perseus, to plead
in excuse that neither had the Bastarnians been invited by
him, nor had they done any thing at his instigation. The
senate neither acquitted the king of the imputation, nor urged
it against him; they only ordered him to be warned to be
very careful to show, that he considered the treaty between
him and the Romans as inviolable. The Dardanians, perceiving
that the Bastarnians, so far from quitting their country,
as they had hoped, became daily more troublesome, as they
were supported by the neighbouring Thracians and Scordiscians,
thinking it necessary to make some effort against them,
though without any reasonable prospect of success, assembled
together in arms from all quarters, at the town that was
nearest to the camp of the Bastarnians. It was now winter,
and they chose that season of the year, as supposing that the
Thracians and Scordiscians would return to their own countries.
As soon as they heard that these were gone, and the
Bastarnians left by themselves, they divided their forces into
two parts, that one might march openly along the straight
road to attack the enemy; and that the other, going round
through a wood, which lay out of sight, might assault them
on the rear. But, before these could arrive at the enemy&#8217;s
post, the fight commenced, and the Dardanians were beaten,
and pursued to the town, which was about twelve miles from
the Bastarnian camp. The victors immediately invested the
city, not doubting that, on the day following, either the enemy
would surrender it from fear, or they might take it by storm.
Meanwhile the other body of Dardanians, which had gone
round, not having heard of the defeat of their countrymen,
<i>easily</i> possessed themselves of the camp of the Bastarnians,
which had been left without a guard. <i>The Bastarnians,
thus deprived of all their provisions and warlike stores,
which were in their camp, and having no means of replacing
them in a hostile country, and at that unfavourable
season, resolved to return to their native home. Having</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1942" id="Page_1942">Pg 1942</a></span>
<i>therefore retreated to the Danube, they found it, to their
great joy, covered with ice, so thick as to seem capable of
sustaining any weight. But when the entire body of men
and cattle, hastening on, and crowding together, pressed on
it at the same time, the ice, splitting under the immense
weight, suddenly parted, and being overcome and broken up,
left in the middle of the water the entire army which it had
supported so long. Most of them were immediately swallowed
in the eddies of the river. The fragments of the broken ice
passed over many of them in their attempt to swim and drowned
them. A few out of the entire nation with difficulty
escaped to either bank, with their persons severely crushed.
About this time, Antiochus, son to Antiochus the Great,
who had been for a long time a hostage at Rome, came into
possession of the kingdom of Syria, on the death of his
brother Seleucus. For Seleucus, whom the Greeks call Philopator,
after having received the kingdom of Syria, which
had been greatly debilitated by the misfortunes of his father,
during an idle reign of twelve years never distinguished by
any memorable enterprise at all, called home from Rome this
his younger brother, sending, in his stead, his own son Demenlius,
according to the terms of the treaty, which allowed the
changing of the hostages from time to time. Antiochus had
but just reached Athens on his way, when Seleucus was
murdered, in consequence of a conspiracy formed by Heliodorus,
one of the nobles. Eumenes and Attalus expelled
him aiming at the crown, and put Antiochus in possession
of it, and valued it highly that they had bound him to them
by this so important a favour. They now began to harbour
some jealousy of the Romans, on account of several trifling
causes of disgust. Antiochus, having gained the kingdom
by their aid, was received by the people with such transports
of joy, that they gave him the surname of Epiphanes, or
Rising Star, because when aliens to the royal blood were
about to seize the throne, he appeared like a propitious star,
to assert his hereditary right. He was not deficient in
capacity or vigour of mind to make a figure in war; but he
was so perverse and indiscreet in the whole tenor of his conduct
and behaviour, that they soon changed the surname
which they had given him, and instead of Epiphanes, called
him Epimanes or Madman. For often having gone forth</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1943" id="Page_1943">Pg 1943</a></span>
<i>from the palace without the knowledge of his servants, with
one or two attendants, crowned with roses, and dressed in
robes embroidered with gold, he used to go through the city,
sometimes striking those that he met with stones that he
carried under his arms; sometimes, on the other hand,
throwing money among the mob, and shouting out, &#8220;Let him
take to whom fortune shall give.&#8221; But at another time he
used to go through the workshops of the goldsmiths, and
engravers and other artisans, arguing vainly concerning
the art of each; at another time he engaged in conversation
in public with any of the plebeian he met; again, wandering
around the common taverns, he indulged in potations with
foreigners and strangers of the lowest grade. If by chance
he had learned that any young men were celebrating an untimely
banquet, he himself at once came upon them suddenly,
with a glass and a concert, revelling and wantoning, so that
most of them, struck with terror at the strangeness of the
matter, fled away, and the remainder were silent in fear. It
is ascertained also that, in the public baths, he used to bathe
with the mob. As however there he was in the habit of
using the most precious unguents, they report that a plebeian
one day said to him. &#8220;You are happy, O king: you savour
of perfumes of the highest value.&#8221; To whom Antiochus,
delighted at his words, said, &#8220;I will immediately make you
so happy, that you will confess that you are sated:&#8221; and
immediately ordered a large pot of most valuable unguent
to be poured on his head, so that, the floor being drenched
with it, both the others began to fall on the slippery surface,
and the king himself, laughing heartily, came to the ground.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e20" name="e20"></a>20</span>
<i>Lastly, having assumed the Roman gown instead of
his royal robes, he used to go about the market-place, as
lie had seen done by the candidates for office at Rome,
saluting and embracing each of the plebeians; soliciting at
one time for the &aelig;dileship, at another for the plebeian tribuneship,
until at last he obtained the office by the suffrages
of the people, and then, according to the Roman</i> custom, he
took his seat in an ivory chair, where he heard causes, and
listened to debates on the most trivial matters.
So far was his mind from adhering to any routine, for
it wandered through every sort of life, that it was not
ascertained either by himself or any one else what was his
real character. He was accustomed not to speak to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1944" id="Page_1944">Pg 1944</a></span>
friends, nor scarcely afford a smile, to his acquaintance. By
an inconsistent kind of liberality, he made himself and others
subjects of ridicule; for to some in the most elevated stations,
and who thought highly of themselves, he would give
childish presents of sweetmeats, cakes, or toys; others expecting
nothing he enriched. Wherefore to many he appeared
not to know what he was doing; some said that he acted from
a silly, sportive temper; others, that he was evidently mad.
In two great and honourable instances, however, he showed
a spirit truly royal,&mdash;in the presents which he made to
several cities, and the honour he paid to the gods. To the
inhabitants of Megalopolis, in Arcadia, he made a promise to
build a wall round their city, and he gave them the greater
part of the money requisite for the purpose. At Tegea he
began to erect a magnificent theatre of marble. At Cyzicum,
he presented a set of golden utensils for the service of one
table in the Prytaneum, the state-room of the city; where
such as are entitled to that honour dine together. To the
Rhodians he gave presents of every kind that their convenience
required, but none very remarkable. Of the magnificence
of his notions, in every thing respecting the gods, the
temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens can be a sufficient
testimony: being the only one in the world, the plan of which
was suitable to the greatness of the deity. He likewise ornamented
Delos with altars of extraordinary beauty, and abundance
of statues. A magnificent temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,
which he promised to build at Antioch, of which not only the
ceilings, but all the walls, were to be covered with plates of
gold, and many other edifices which he intended in various
places, he did not finish, as his reign was very short. He
surpassed his predecessors, too, in the magnificence of the
public games of every description; of which all the games
but one were after their own custom, and celebrated by an
immense number of Grecian actors. He gave a show of
gladiators in the Roman manner, which at first, among &amp;
people unaccustomed to such sights, caused more terror than
pleasure; but by frequently repeating them, and sometimes
permitting the combatants to go no further than wounds, at
other times to fight until one was killed, he rendered such
kind of shows not only familiar to people&#8217;s eyes, but even
agreeable, and kindled in most of the young men a passion for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1945" id="Page_1945">Pg 1945</a></span>
arms; so much so that, although, at the beginning, he was
obliged to entice gladiators from Rome, by high rewards, <i>he
soon found a sufficient number in his own dominions willing to
perform for a moderate hire. But he displayed the same
worthlessness and levity in exhibiting the games, as in the rest
of his life, so that nothing could be seen more magnificent than
the preparation for the games, nothing more vile or contemptible
than the king himself. And when this appeared often on other
occasions, it was then most conspicuous in those games, which,
in emulation of the magnificence of those which were given by
Paulus in Macedon, after the conquest of Perseus, he exhibited
at immense expense, and with corresponding dishonour.
To return, however, to the Roman affairs, from which the
mention of this king has caused us to digress too far. Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus, after holding the government of
Sardinia two years, resigned it to Servius Cornelius Sulla,
the pr&aelig;tor, and, coming home to Rome, triumphed over the
Sardinians. We are told that he brought such a multitude of
captives from, that island, that from the long continuance of
the sale, &#8220;Sardinians for sale&#8221; became a vulgar proverb, to
denote things of little price. Both the consuls (Sc&aelig;vola and
Lepidus) triumphed over the Ligurians; Lepidus over the
Gauls also. Then were held the elections of magistrates for
the ensuing year. Spurius Postumius Albinus and Quintus
Mucius Sc&aelig;vola were chosen consuls. In the election of pr&aelig;tors,
fortune involved Lucius or Cneius Cornelius Scipio, son of
Publius Africanus, one of the candidates, in a very invidious
struggle with Caius Cicereius, who had been his father&#8217;s
secretary. For, after five pr&aelig;tors had been declared, namely,
Caius Cassius Longinus, Publius Furius Philus, Lucius Claudius
Asellus, Marcus Atilius Serranus, and Cneius Servilius
C&aelig;pio; although Scipio struggled hard to be admitted even in
the last place, yet he was thought to have degenerated so far
from the virtues of his father, that Cicereius would have been
preferred by the votes of all the centuries, had not the latter,
with singular modesty, corrected what might be considered
either the fault of fortune or error of the elections. He could
not reconcile it to himself, that, in a struggle in the elections,
he should gain the victory over the son of his patron; but immediately
throwing off the white gown, he became, from a competitor</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1946" id="Page_1946">Pg 1946</a></span>
<i>sure of success, the grateful friend and supporter of
the interest of his rival. Thus, by the help of Cicereius
Scipio obtained an honour which he did not seem likely to
gain from the people, and which reflected greater glory on
Cicereius than on himself.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e21" name="e21"></a>21</span>
<i>The provinces assigned to the consuls were Gaul and
Liguria. On the pr&aelig;tors casting lots, the city jurisdiction fell
to Caius Cassius Longinus</i>, and the foreign, to Lucius Cornelius
Scipio. The province of Sardinia fell to Marcus Atilius,
who was ordered to sail over to Corsica with a new legion,
raised by the consuls, and consisting of five thousand foot and
three hundred horse; and while he was engaged in carrying
on the war there, Cornelius was continued in command, that
he might hold the government of Sardinia. To Cneius Servilius
C&aelig;pio, for the service of Farther Spain, and to Publius
Furius Philus for that of Hither Spain, the following troops
were assigned&mdash;to each, three thousand Roman foot with one
hundred and fifty horse, and five thousand Latin foot with three
hundred horse. Sicily was decreed to Lucius Claudius, without
any reinforcement. The consuls were ordered to levy
two more legions, of the regular numbers of foot and horse,
and to demand from the allies ten thousand foot and six hundred
horse: but they met great difficulty in making the levies;
for the pestilence, which the year before had fallen on the
cattle, in the present year attacked the human species. Such
as were seized by it, seldom survived the seventh day; those
who did survive, lingered under a tedious disorder, which
generally turned to a quartan ague. The slaves especially
perished, of whom heaps lay unburied on all the roads. The
necessary requisites could not be procured for the funerals of
those of free condition. The bodies were consumed by putrefaction,
without being touched by the dogs or vultures; and
it was universally observed, that during that and the preceding
year, while the mortality of cattle and men was so great,
no vultures were any where seen. Of the public priests,
there died by this contagion, Cneius Servilius C&aelig;pio, father
of the pr&aelig;tor, a pontiff; Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of
Tiberius, decemvir of religious rites; Publius &AElig;lius P&aelig;tus,
and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, augurs; Caius Mamilius
Vitulus, chief curio; and Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1947" id="Page_1947">Pg 1947</a></span>
pontiff. In the vacant places of pontiffs<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> were chosen * * * *
and Caius Sulpicius Galba, in the room of Tuditanus. The
augurs substituted were, Titus Veturius Gracchus Sempronianus,
in place of Gracchus; and Quintus &AElig;lius P&aelig;tas, in place
of Publius &AElig;lius. Caius Sempronius Longus was made decemvir
of religious rites, and Caius Scribonius Curio, chief curio.
When the termination of the plague was not visible, the
senate voted that the decemvirs should consult the Sibylline
books; and, by their directions, a supplication of one day was
performed; and the people assembled in the forum made a
vow, whilst Quintus Marcius Philippus dictated the words,
that &#8220;if the sickness and pestilence should be removed out of
the Roman territory, they would solemnize a festival and
thanksgiving of two days&#8217; continuance.&#8221; In the district of
Veii, a boy was born with two heads; at Sinuessa, one with
a single hand; and at Oximum, a girl with teeth; in the
middle of the day, the sky being perfectly clear, a rainbow
was seen, stretching over the temple of Saturn, in the Roman
forum, and three suns shone at once; and the following night
many lights were seen gliding through the air, about Lanuvium.
The people of Cære affirmed that there had appeared
in their town a snake with a mane, having its body marked
with spots like gold; and it was fully proved that an ox had
spoken in Campania.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e22" name="e22"></a>22</span>
On the nones of June,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> the ambassadors returned from
Africa, who having first had an interview with king Masinissa,
proceeded to Carthage; but they received much more
certain information respecting what had taken place in Carthage
from the king than from the Carthaginians themselves.
They said they had sufficient proof that ambassadors had
come from king Perseus, and that an audience of the senate
was given to them by night, in the temple of &AElig;sculapius;
and the king asserted, that the Carthaginians had sent ambassadors
to Macedon, which they themselves did not positively
deny. The senate, hereupon, resolved to send an embassy to
Macedonia. They made choice of Caius L&aelig;lius, Marcus
Valerius Messala, and Sextus Digitius, who accordingly proceeded
thither. About this time, Perseus, because some of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1948" id="Page_1948">Pg 1948</a></span>the Dolopians were refractory, and in the matters in dispute
were for referring the decision from the king to the Romans,
marched an army into their country, and reduced the whole nation
under his jurisdiction and dominion. Thence he passed
through the mountains of &#338;ta, and on account of some religious
scruples affecting his mind, went up to Delphi, to apply to
the oracle. His sudden appearance in the middle of Greece
caused a great alarm, not only in the neighbouring states, but
also caused alarming intelligence to be brought into Asia to king
Eumenes. He staid only three days at Delphi, and then returned
to his own dominions, through Phthiotis, Achaia, and
Thessaly, without doing the least injury or damage to those
countries. He did not think it sufficient to conciliate the
esteem of the several states through which his road lay; but
despatched either ambassadors or letters to every one of the
Grecian powers, requesting that they would &#8220;think no more of
the animosities which had subsisted between them and his father;
that the disputes had not been so violent that they might
not, and ought not, to cease with regard to himself. On
his part, there was no kind of obstacle to the forming of a
cordial friendship.&#8221; Above all, he wished particularly to find
some way of ingratiating himself with the Ach&aelig;an nation.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e23" name="e23"></a>23</span>
This nation, and the state of Athens, solitary exceptions
to the whole of Greece, had carried their resentment to such
a length, as to prohibit the Macedonians entering their territories.
In consequence of this, Macedonia became a place of
refuge for slaves running away out of Achaia; for, as the
Ach&aelig;ans had forbidden the inhabitants of Macedon to set
foot in their territories, they could not presume to pass the
boundaries of that kingdom. When Perseus observed this,
he seized all the fugitives, and wrote a letter * * *
* * * * &#8220;but that they ought to consider of
the proper means of preventing such elopements for the
future.&#8221; When this letter was read by the pro&aelig;tor Xenarchus,
who was seeking a path to private influence with the king,
the greater part who were present, but especially those who,
contrary to their expectations, were about to receive the
slaves they had lost, commended the moderation and kindness
with which it was written; but Callierates, one who thought
that the safety of the nation depended on the treaty with
Rome being preserved inviolate, delivered his sentiments to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1949" id="Page_1949">Pg 1949</a></span>
this effect;&mdash;&#8220;To some of you, Ach&aelig;ans, the matter under
consideration appears trifling and unimportant. I think
that a very great and important subject is not only under
consideration, but to a certain extent decided. For we, who
prohibited the kings of Macedonia, and all their subjects,
from entering our territories, and made a perpetual decree,
not to receive from those sovereigns either ambassadors or
messengers, by whom the minds of any of us might be tampered
with; we, I say, listen to the king speaking in a manner,
though absent, and what is more, approve of his discourse.
Although wild beasts generally reject and shun the food laid
in their way for their destruction; yet we, blinded by the
specious offer of an insignificant favour, swallow the bait, and
would, for the sake of recovering a parcel of wretched slaves,
of no value worth mentioning, suffer our independence to be
undermined and subverted. For who does not see that a
way is being paved to an alliance with the king, by which the
treaty with Rome in which all our interests are involved would
be violated? That there must be a war between Perseus and
the Romans, is not, I believe, a matter of doubt to any one,
and the struggle which was expected during the life of Philip,
and interrupted by his death, will, now that he is dead, most
certainly ensue. Philip, you all know, had two sons, Demetrius
and Perseus. Demetrius was much superior in birth,
on the mother&#8217;s side, in merit, capacity, and in the esteem of
the Macedonian nation. But Philip, having set up the crown
as the prize of hatred towards the Romans, put Demetrius to
death, for no other crime than having contracted a friendship
with that people; and made Perseus king, because he knew
him to be an enemy to the Roman people almost before he
determined on making him king. Accordingly, what else has
the present king done since his father&#8217;s death, than prepare for
the war? In the first place, to the terror of all the surrounding
nations, he brought the Bastarnians into Dardania; where
if they had made a lasting settlement, Greece would have
found them more troublesome neighbours than Asia found
the Gauls. Disappointed in that hope, he did not drop his
design of a war; nay, if we choose to speak the truth, he has
already commenced hostilities. He subdued Dolopia by force
of arms; and would not listen when they wished to appeal
concerning their disputes to the arbitration of the Romans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1950" id="Page_1950">Pg 1950</a></span>
Then, crossing &#338;ta, that he might show himself in the very
centre of Greece, he went up to Delphi. To what, think you
did his taking a journey so uncommon tend? He next traversed
Thessaly; and as to his refraining on his route from
doing injury to the people whom he hated, I dread his machinations
the more on that very account. He then sent a letter
to us, with the hollow show of an act of kindness, and bade us to
consider measures by which we may not require this gift for
the future; that is, to repeal the decree by which the Macedonians
are excluded from Peloponnesus; to receive again
ambassadors from him their king; to renew intimacies contracted
with his principal subjects; and, in a short time, we
should see Macedonian armies, with himself at their head, crossing
over the narrow strait from Delphi into Peloponnesus, and
thus we should be blended with the Macedonians, while they
are arming themselves against the Romans. My opinion is,
that we ought not to resolve on any new proceeding, but to
keep every thing in its present state, until the question shall
be reduced to a certainty, whether these our fears be well
or ill grounded. If the peace between the Romans and Macedonians
shall continue inviolate, then may we also have a friendship
and intercourse with Perseus; but to think of such a
measure now, appears to me both premature and dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e24" name="e24"></a>24</span>
After him, Arco, brother to the pr&aelig;tor Xenarchus, said:&mdash;&#8220;Callicrates
hath made the delivery of our sentiments difficult
both to me and to every one who differs in opinion from
him; for after his pleading in favour of the Roman alliance,
alleging that it was undermined and attacked, (although no one
either undermines or attacks it,) he has caused that whoever
dissents from him must seem to argue against the cause of the
Romans. In the first place, as if he had not been here with
us, but had just left the senate-house of the Roman people, or
had been admitted into the privy councils of kings, he knows
and tells us every transaction that passes in secret. Nay
more, he divines what would have happened if Philip had
lived, why Perseus became heir of the kingdom: in such a
manner, what are the intentions of the Macedonians, and what
the thoughts of the Romans. But we, who neither know for
what cause, nor in what manner, Demetrius perished, nor
what Philip would have done, if he had lived, ought to accommodate
our resolutions to the transactions that have passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1951" id="Page_1951">Pg 1951</a></span>
in open view. We know that Perseus, on his coming to the
throne, sent ambassadors to Rome, and received the title of
king from the Roman people, and we hear that ambassadors
came from Rome to the king, and were graciously received
by him. I consider that all these circumstances are signs of
peace, not of war; and that the Romans cannot be offended,
if as we imitated their conduct in war, so we follow now their
example in peace. For my part, I cannot see why we alone,
of all mankind, wage implacable war against the kingdom of
the Macedonians. Are we exposed to insult by a close neighbourhood
to Macedon? or are we like the Dolopians, whom
Perseus subdued lately, the weakest of all states? No; on
the contrary, by the bounty of the gods, we are sufficiently
secured, as well by our own strength, as by the remoteness of
our situation. But we have as much reason to apprehend ill
treatment, as the Thessalians and &AElig;tolians; have we no more
credit or influence with the Romans, though we were always
their friends and allies, than the &AElig;tolians, who but lately
were their enemies? Whatever reciprocal rights the &AElig;tolians,
the Thessalians, the Epirots, in short, every state in Greece,
allow to subsist between them and the Macedonians, let us
allow the same. Why have we alone what may be termed a
cursed neglect of the ties of humanity? Philip may have
done some act on account of which we should pass this decree
against him when in arms and waging war against us: What
has Perseus deserved, a king just seated on the throne, guiltless
of all injury against us, and effacing by his own kindness his
father&#8217;s feuds? Why should we be his only enemies? Although
I might make this assertion, that so great have been
our obligations to the former kings of Macedon, that the ill
usage, suffered from a single prince of their line, if any has
really been suffered from Philip, * * * especially after his
death. When a Roman fleet was lying at Cenchre&aelig;, and the
consul, with his army, was at Elatia, we were three days in
council, deliberating whether we should follow the Romans
or Philip. Now, granting that the fear of immediate danger
from the Romans had no influence on our judgments, yet there
was, certainly, something that made our deliberation last so
long; and that was, the connexion which had long subsisted
between us and the Macedonians; the distinguished favours
in ancient times received from their kings. Let the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1952" id="Page_1952">Pg 1952</a></span>
considerations prevail at present,&mdash;not to make us his singular
friends, but to hinder us from becoming his singular
enemies. Let us not, Callicrates, pretend what is not even
thought of. No one advises us to form a new alliance, or sign
a new treaty, by which we might inconsiderately compromise
ourselves, but merely that we may have the intercourse of affording
and demanding justice, and that we may not by excluding
his subjects from our territories, exclude ourselves
from his dominions, and that our slaves may not have any
refuge to fly to. How does this operate against the Roman
treaty? Why do we give an air of importance and suspicion
to a matter which is trifling and open to the world? Why
do we raise groundless alarms? Why, for the sake of ingratiating
ourselves still more particularly with the Romans,
render others odious and suspected? If war shall take place
even Perseus himself does not doubt our taking part with the
Romans. While peace continues, let animosities if they are
not terminated, be at least suspended.&#8221; When those who
approved of the king&#8217;s letter expressed their approbation of
this speech, the decree was postponed, owing to the indignation
of the chief men that Perseus should obtain by a letter of a few
lines a matter which he did not even deign worthy of an embassy.
Ambassadors were afterwards sent by the king, when
a council was held at Megalopolis; but exertions were made
by those, who dreaded a rupture with Rome, that they should
not be admitted to an audience.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e25" name="e25"></a>25</span>
During this period the fury of the &AElig;tolians, being
turned against themselves, seemed likely to cause the total extinction
of that nation by the massacres of the contending
parties. Then both parties, being wearied, sent ambassadors
to Rome, and also opened a negotiation between themselves
for the restoration of concord: but this was broken off by an
act of barbarity, which revived their old quarrels. When a
return to their country had been promised to the exiles from
Hypata, who were of the faction of Proxenus, and the public
faith had been pledged to them by Eupolemus, the chief man
of the state; eighty persons of distinction, whom even Eupolemus,
among the rest of the multitude, had gone forth to
meet on their return, though they were received with kind salutation,
and right hands were pledged to them, were butchered on
entering the gate, though they implored in vain the honour that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1953" id="Page_1953">Pg 1953</a></span>
had been pledged, and the gods the witnesses of the transaction.
On this the war blazed out anew, with greater fury
than ever. Caius Valerius L&aelig;vinus, Appius Claudius Pulcher,
Caius Memmius, Marcus Popilius, and Lucius Canuleius,
being sent as ambassadors by the senate, arrived in that country.
When the deputies from both parties pleaded their respective
causes with great energy, Proxenus appeared to have
greatly the advantage as well in the justice of his cause as in
eloquence; a few days after, he was poisoned by his wife
Orthobula, who being convicted of the crime, went into banishment.
The same madness was wasting the Cretans also;
but, on the arrival of Quintus Minucius, lieutenant-general,
who was sent with ten ships to quiet their contentions, the inhabitants
had some prospect of peace; however, they only
concluded a suspension of arms for six months, after which
the war was again renewed with much greater violence.
About this time, the Lycians, too, were harassed in war by the
Rhodians. But the wars of foreign nations among themselves,
or the several methods in which they were conducted,
it is not my business to detail; since I have a task of more
than sufficient weight in writing the deeds performed by the
Roman people.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e26" name="e26"></a>26</span>
In Spain, the Celtiberians, (who, since their reduction
by Tiberius Gracchus, and their consequent surrender to him,
had remained quiet; when Marcus Titinius, the pr&aelig;tor, held
the government of that province,) on the arrival of Appius
Claudius, resumed their arms, and commenced hostilities by
a sudden attack on the Roman camp. It was nearly the first
dawn when the sentinels on the rampart, and the men on
guard before the gates, descrying the enemy approaching at
a distance, shouted &#8220;to arms.&#8221; Appius Claudius instantly displayed
the signal of battle; and, after exhorting the troops, in
few words, ordered them to rush out by three gates at once.
But they were opposed by the Celtiberians in the very
passage; and in consequence, the fight was for some time
equal on both sides, as, on account of the narrowness, the
Romans could not all come into action in the entrance; then
pressing forward on one another, whenever it was possible,
they made their way beyond the trenches, so that they were
able to extend their line, and form a front equal to the wings
of the enemy, by which they were surrounded; and now they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1954" id="Page_1954">Pg 1954</a></span>
made their onset with such sudden impetuosity, that the Celtiberians
could not support the assault. Before the second
hour, they were driven from the field; about fifteen thousand
were either killed or made prisoners, and thirty-two standards
were taken. Their camp, also, was stormed the same day,
and a conclusion put to the war; for those who survived the
battle fled by different ways, to their several towns, and
thenceforth submitted quietly to the Roman government.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e27" name="e27"></a>27</span>
Quintus Fulvius Flaccus and Aulus Postumius, being
created censors, reviewed the senate this year. Marcus
&AElig;milius Lepidus, chief pontiff, was chosen chief of the senate.
Nine senators were expelled. The remarkable censures pronounced
were on Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis, who had
been pr&aelig;tor in Spain two years before; on Lucius Cornelius
Scipio, who was then pr&aelig;tor and exercised the jurisdiction
between natives and foreigners; and on Cneius Fulvius,
brother to the censor, and, as Valerius Antias says, partner in
property. The consuls, after offering vows in the Capitol, set
out for their provinces. Marcus &AElig;milius was commissioned
by the senate to suppress an insurrection of the Patavians in
Venetia; for their own ambassadors had given information
that by the violent contests of opposing factions they had
broken out into civil war. The ambassadors who had gone
into &AElig;tolia, to suppress commotions of a similar kind, reported
on their return, that the outrageous temper of that
nation could not be restrained. The consul&#8217;s arrival among
the Patavians saved them from ruin; and having no other
business in the province, he returned to Rome. The present
censors were the first who contracted for paving the streets
of Rome with flint stones, for laying with gravel the foundation
of roads outside the city, and for forming raised foot-ways on the
sides; for building bridges in several places; and affording seats
in the theatre to the pr&aelig;tors and &aelig;diles; they fixed up goals in
the circus, with balls on the goals for marking the number of
courses of the chariots; and erected iron grates, through which
wild beasts might be let in. They caused the Capitoline hill
to be paved with flint, and erected a piazza from the temple of
Saturn, in the Capitol, to the council-chamber, and over that
a public hall. On the outside of the gate Trigemina, they also
paved a market-place with stones, and enclosed it with a paling;
they repaired the &AElig;milian portico, and formed an ascent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1955" id="Page_1955">Pg 1955</a></span>
by stairs, from the Tiber to the market-place. They paved,
with flint, the portico, from the same gate to the Aventine, and
built a court-house: contracted for walls to be built at Galatia
and Oximum, and, after selling lots of ground there, which
belonged to the public, employed the money arising from the
sale in building shops round the forums of both places. Fulvius
Flaccus (for Postumius <i>declared</i>, that, without a decree
of the senate, or order of the people, he would not expend any
money belonging to them) agreed for building a temple of
Jupiter at Pisaurum; and another at Fundi; for bringing
water to Pollentia; for paving the street of Pisaurum, and for
many various works at Sinuessa; among which were, the
structure of a sewer to fall into the river, the enclosure of the
forum with porticoes and shops, and erection of three statues
of Janus. These works were all contracted for by one of the
censors, and gained him a high degree of favour with those
colonists. Their censorship was also very active and strict
in the superintendence of the morals of the people. Many
knights were deprived of their horses.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="e28" name="e28"></a>28</span>
At the close of the year, there was a thanksgiving, for
one day, on account of the advantages obtained in Spain under
the conduct and auspices of Appius Claudius, the proconsul;
and they sacrificed twenty victims, of the larger kinds. There
was also a supplication, for another day, at the temples of
Ceres, Liber, and Liberia, because a violent earthquake with
the destruction of many houses was announced from the Sabines.
When Appius Claudius came home from Spain, the
senate voted that he should enter the city in ovation. The
election of consuls now came on: when they were held, after
a violent struggle in consequence of the great number of candidates,
Lucius Postumius Albinus and Marcus Popilius
L&aelig;nas were elected consuls. Then Numerius Fabius Buteo,
Marcus Matienus, Caius Cicereius, Marcus Furius Crassipes,
a second time, Marcus Atilius Serranus, a second time,
and Caius Cluvius Saxula, a second time, were chosen
pr&aelig;tors. After the elections were finished, Appius Claudius
Centho, entering the city in ovation over the Celtiberians,
conveyed to the treasury ten thousand pounds&#8217; weight of silver,
and five thousand of gold. Cneius Cornelius was inaugurated
flamen of Jupiter. In the same year a tablet was hung up in
the temple of mother Matuta, with this inscription:&mdash;<span class="smcap">under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1956" id="Page_1956">Pg 1956</a></span></span>
<span class="smcap">the command and auspices of tiberius sempronius gracchus,
consul, a legion and army of the roman people
subdued sardinia; in which province above eighty
thousand of the enemy were killed or taken. having
executed the business of the public with the happiest
success; having recovered the revenues, and restored
them</span> <i>to the commonwealth</i>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">he brought home the army
safe, uninjured, and enriched with spoil, and, a second
time, entered the city of rome in triumph. in commemoration
of which event he presented this tablet as an
offering to jupiter</span>. A map of the island of Sardinia was
engraved on the tablet, and pictures of the battles fought there
were delineated on it. Several small exhibitions of gladiators
were given to the public this year; the only one particularly
remarkable, was that of Titus Flamininus, which he gave on
occasion of his father&#8217;s death, and it was accompanied with a
donation of meat, a feast, and stage-plays, and lasted four
days. Yet, in the whole of this great exhibition, only
seventy-four men fought in three days. <i>The close of this year
was rendered memorable by the proposal of a new and important
rule, which occupied the state, since it was debated with
great emotion. Hitherto, as the law stood, women were as equally
capable of receiving inheritances as men. From which it happened
that the wealth of the most illustrious houses was frequently
transferred into other families, to the great detriment, as it
was generally supposed, of the state; to which it was no small
advantage that there should be a sufficiency of wealth to the
descendants of distinguished ancestors, by which they might
support and do honour to their nobility of birth, which otherwise
would form a burden rather than honour to them. Besides,
since with the now growing power of the empire, the riches of
private persons also were increasing, fear was felt, lest the minds
of women, being rather inclined by nature to luxury, and the
pursuit of a more elegant routine of life, and deriving from unbounded
wealth incentives to desire, should fall into immoderate
expenses and luxury, and should subsequently chance to depart
from the ancient sanctity of manners, so that there would
be a change of morals no less than of the manner of living.
To obviate these evils, Quintus Voconius Saxa, plebeian tribune,
proposed to the people, that &#8220;no person who should be
rated after the censorship of Aulus Postumius and Quintius</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1957" id="Page_1957">Pg 1957</a></span>
<i>Fulvius should make any woman, whether married or unmarried
his heir; also, that no woman, whether married or unmarried,
should be capable of receiving, by inheritance, goods
exceeding the value of one hundred thousand sesterces.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
Voconius, also, thought it proper to provide that estates
should not be exhausted by the number of legacies, which sometimes
happened. Accordingly he added a clause to his law,
that no person should bequeath to any person or persons property
exceeding in value what was to go to the immediate heirs.&#8221;
This latter clause readily met the general approbation; it
appeared reasonable, and calculated to press severely on nobody.
Concerning the former clause, by which women were
utterly disqualified from receiving inheritances, there were many
doubts. Marcus Cato put an end to all hesitation, having been
already, on a former occasion, a most determined adversary
and reprover of women, in the defence of the Oppian law, who,
although sixty-five years of age, with loud voice and good
lungs advocated this law of still greater importance, against
them, inveighing, with his usual asperity, against the tyranny
of women, and their unsufferable insolence token opulent: on
the present occasion, too, he declaimed against the pride and
arrogance of the rich matrons, &#8220;because they oftentimes, after
bringing a great dowry to their husband, kept back and retained
for themselves a great sum of money, and lent that money
on such terms afterwards to their husbands, on their asking it,
that as often as they were angry they immediately pressed importunately
on their husbands, as if they were strange debtors,
by a reserved slave who followed them and daily importuned
payment.&#8221; Moved by indignation at this, they voted for passing
the law as Voconius proposed it.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the censor, spoiled the temple of Juno at Lacinium
of the marble tiles, to roof a temple which he was dedicating.
The tiles were returned by a decree of the senate. Eumenes, the king of
Asia, complained before the senate of Perseus, the king of Macedon; the
outrages of the latter are laid before the Roman people. And when a
war was proclaimed against him on account of these, Publius Licinius
Crassus, the consul to whom it was intrusted, passed over into Macedon,
and in trifling expeditions and cavalry actions, fought with
Perseus in Thessaly, by no means successfully. An arbiter was
appointed by the senate to decide concerning land disputed between
Masinissa and the Carthaginians. Ambassadors were sent to request
of the allied states and kings, that they would abide by their agreements,
as the Rhodians wavered. The lustrum was closed by the censors.
Two hundred and fifty-seven thousand two hundred and thirty-one
citizens were rated. It includes besides, the successes gained over the
Corsicans and Ligurians.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f1" name="f1"></a>1</span>
When Lucius Postumius Albinus and Marcus Popilius
L&aelig;nas brought before the senate first of all the distribution of
the provinces, Liguria was assigned the joint province of both,
with directions that they should enlist new legions, by which
they would hold that province (two were decreed to each);
and also ten thousand foot and six hundred horse of the Latin
confederates; and as a supplement to the army in Spain,
three thousand Roman foot and two hundred horse. One
thousand five hundred Roman foot and one hundred horse
were ordered to be raised; with which the pr&aelig;tor, to whose
lot Sardinia might fall, should cross over to Corsica, and
carry on the war there; and it was further ordered, that in
the mean time the former pr&aelig;tor, Marcus Atilius, should
obtain the province of Sardinia. The pr&aelig;tors then cast lots
for their provinces. Aulus Atilius Serranus obtained the
city jurisdiction; Caius Cluvius Saxula, that between natives
and foreigners; Numerius Fabius Buteo, Hither Spain; Marcus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1959" id="Page_1959">Pg 1959</a></span>
Matienus, Farther Spain; Marcus Furius Crassipes,
Sicily; and Caius Cicereius, Sardinia. The senate resolved
that, before the magistrates went abroad, Lucius Postumius
should go into Campania, to fix the bounds between the lands
which were private property and those which belonged to the
public; for it was understood that individuals, by gradually
extending their bounds, had taken possession of a very considerable
share of the common lands. He, being enraged with
the people of Pr&aelig;neste because, when he had gone thither as
private individual to offer sacrifice in the temple of Fortune,
no honour had been paid him, either in public or private, by
the people of Pr&aelig;neste, before he set out from Rome, sent a
letter to Pr&aelig;neste, ordering the chief magistrate to meet him,
and to provide him lodging at the public expense; and that,
at his departure, cattle should be ready to carry his baggage.
No consul before him ever put the allies to any trouble or
expense whatever. Magistrates were furnished with mules,
tents, and every other requisite for a campaign, in order that
they might not make any such demands. They had private
lodgings, in which they behaved with courtesy and kindness,
and their houses at Rome were always open to their hosts
with whom they used to lodge. Ambassadors indeed sent to
any place, on a sudden emergency, demanded each a single
horse in the several towns through which their journey lay;
but the allies never contributed any other portion of the expense
of the Roman magistrates. The resentment of the consul,
which, even if well founded, ought not to have been exerted
during his office, and the too modest or too timid acquiescence
of the Pr&aelig;nestines, gave to the magistrates, as if by
an approved precedent, the privilege of imposing orders of
this sort, which grew more burdensome daily.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f2" name="f2"></a>2</span>
In the beginning of this year the ambassadors, who had
been sent to &AElig;tolia and Macedon, returned, and reported
that &#8220;they had not been able to obtain an interview with
Perseus, as some of his court said that he was abroad, others
that he was sick; both of which were false pretences. Nevertheless,
that it was quite evident that war was in preparation,
and that he would no longer put off the appeal to arms. That
in &AElig;tolia, likewise, the dissensions grew daily more violent;
and the leaders of the contending parties were not to be
restrained by their authority.&#8221; As a war with Macedon was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1960" id="Page_1960">Pg 1960</a></span>
daily expected, the senate resolved, that before it broke out all
prodigies should be expiated, and the favour of such gods, as
should be found expressed in the books of the Fates, invoked
by supplications. It was said that at Lanuvium the appearance
of large fleets was seen in the air; that at Privernum
black wool grew out of the ground; that in the territory of
Veii, at Remens, a shower of stones fell; and that the whole
Pomptine district was covered with clouds of locusts; also
that in the Gallic province, where a plough was at work,
fishes sprung up from under the earth as it was turned. On
account of these prodigies the books of the Fates were accordingly
consulted, and the decemvirs directed both to what gods
and with what victims, sacrifices should be offered; likewise that
a supplication should be performed, in expiation of the prodigies;
and also that another, which had been vowed in the
preceding year for the health of the people, should be celebrated,
and likewise a solemn festival. Accordingly, sacrifices
were offered in accordance with the written directions of the
decemvirs.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f3" name="f3"></a>3</span>
In the same year, the temple of Juno Lacinia was uncovered.
Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the censor, was erecting a
temple to Equestrian Fortune, which he had vowed when
pr&aelig;tor during the Celtiberian war, with anxious desire that
it should not be surpassed by any other at Rome, either in
size or magnificence. Thinking that he would add a very great
ornament to this temple if the tiles were marble, he went to
Bruttium, and stripped, off about the half of those belonging to
the temple of the Lacinian Juno; for he computed that so
many would be sufficient to cover the one he was building.
Ships were in readiness to take on board the materials, while
the allies were deterred by the authority of the censor from
preventing the sacrilege. When the censor returned, the
marble was landed and carried to the temple; but though he
made no mention of the place from which it was brought, yet
such an affair could not be concealed. Accordingly, considerable
murmuring arose in the senate; from all sides of
the house a demand was made that the consuls should lay
that matter before the senate. When the censor, on being
summoned, appeared in the senate-house, they all, both separately
and in a body, inveighed against him with great
asperity. They cried out that &#8220;he was not content with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1961" id="Page_1961">Pg 1961</a></span>
violating the most venerable temple in all that part of the
world, a temple which neither Pyrrhus nor Hannibal had
violated; but he had stripped it shamefully, and almost
demolished it. Though created censor for the purpose of
regulating men&#8217;s manners, and bound in duty, according to
long-established rules, to enforce the repairing of edifices for
public worship, and the keeping them in due order, he had
nevertheless gone about through the cities of the allies, stripping
the roofs of their sacred buildings, and even demolishing
them. In a word, what might be deemed scandalous if
practised on private houses, he committed against the temples
of the immortal gods; and that he involved the Roman people
in the guilt of impiety, building temples with the ruins of
temples; as if the deities were not the same in all places, but
that some should be decorated with the spoils of others.&#8221;
When it was evident what were the sentiments of the senators,
before their opinion was asked; when the question was put,
they unanimously concurred in voting, that a contract should
be entered into for carrying the tiles back to the temple, and
that atonements should be offered to Juno. What regarded
the atonements was carefully executed; the contractors made
a report that they were obliged to leave the marble in the
court of the temple, because no workman could be found who
knew how to replace the same.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f4" name="f4"></a>4</span>
Of the pr&aelig;tors who set out for the provinces, Numerius
Fabius, on his way to Hither Spain, died at Marseilles.
Therefore when this was announced by envoys from Marseilles,
the senate resolved that Publius Furius and Cneius
Servilius, to whom successors had been sent, should cast lots
to determine which of them should hold the government of
Hither Spain, with a continuation of authority; and the lot
determined, very fortunately, that Publius Furius, whose
province it had formerly been, should continue. During the
same year, on its appearing that large tracts of land in Gaul
and Liguria, which had been taken in war, lay unoccupied,
the senate passed a decree, that those lands should be distributed
in single shares; and Aulus Titilius, city pr&aelig;tor, in pursuance
of the said decree, appointed ten commissioners for that
Purpose, namely, Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus, Caius Cassius, Titus
&AElig;butius Carus, Caius Tremellius, Publius Cornelius Cethegus,
Quintus and Lucius Appuleius, Marcus C&aelig;cilius, Caius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1962" id="Page_1962">Pg 1962</a></span>
Salonius, and Caius Munatius. They apportioned ten acres
to each Roman, and three to each Latin colonist. During the
same time in which these transactions took place, ambassadors
came to Rome from &AElig;tolia with representations of the quarrels
and dissensions subsisting in that country; likewise
Thessalian ambassadors, announcing the transactions in Macedon.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f5" name="f5"></a>5</span>
Perseus, revolving in his mind the war, which had been
resolved on during the life-time of his father, endeavoured, by
sending embassies, and by promising a great deal more than
he performed, to attach to himself not only the commonwealth
of Greece, but also each particular state. However the feelings
of the majority were inclined in his favour, and much
better disposed towards him than Eumenes, although all the
states of Greece, and most of the leading men, were under
obligations to the latter for benefits and gifts; and although
he so conducted himself in his sovereignty, that the cities
which were under his dominion would not exchange their condition
for that of any free state. On the contrary, there was
a general report that Perseus, after his father&#8217;s death, had
killed his wife with his own hand; that Apelles, formerly the
agent of his treachery in the destruction of his brother, and
on that account sought anxiously by Philip, for punishment,
being in exile, was invited by him, after the death of his
father, by great promises, to receive a guerdon for rendering
so important services, and was secretly put to death. Although
he had rendered himself infamous by many other
murders, both of his own relations and of others, and possessed
not one good quality to recommend him, yet the
Grecian states in general gave him the preference to Eumenes
who was so affectionate towards his relations, so just toward
his subjects, and so liberal towards all mankind; either because
they were so prejudiced by the fame and dignity of the Macedonian
kings, as to despise a kingdom lately formed, or were
led by a wish for a change in affairs, and wished him to be
exposed to the arms of the Romans. The &AElig;tolians were not
the only people in a state of distraction, on account of the intolerable
burden of their debts: the Thessalians were in the
same situation; and the evil, acting by contagion like a pestilence,
had spread into Perrh&aelig;bia also. As soon as it was
known that the Thessalians were in arms, the senate sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1963" id="Page_1963">Pg 1963</a></span>
Appius Claudius, as ambassador, to examine and adjust their
affairs. He severely reprimanded the leaders of both parties;
and after cancelling so much of the debts as had been accumulated
by iniquitous usury, which he did with the consent
of the greater part of the creditors themselves, he ordered the
remaining just debts to be discharged by annual payments.
Affairs in Perrh&aelig;bia were arranged in the same manner by
the same Appius. In the mean time, Marcellus, at Delphi,
gave a hearing to the disputes of the &AElig;tolians, which they
maintained with no less hostile acrimony than they had
shown against each other in the heat of their civil war. Perceiving
that they vied with each other in inconsiderate
violence, he did not choose to make any determination, to
lighten or aggravate the grievances of either party, but required
of both alike to cease from hostilities, and, forgetting
what was past, to put an end to their quarrels. The good
faith of the mutual reconciliation was confirmed by a reciprocal
exchange of hostages.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f6" name="f6"></a>6</span>
Corinth was agreed upon as the place where the
hostages should be lodged. Marcellus crossed over from
Delphi, and the &AElig;tolian council, into Peloponnesus, where
lie had summoned a diet of the Ach&aelig;ans. There, by the
praises which he bestowed on that nation, for having resolutely
maintained their old decree, which prohibited the
admission of the Macedonian kings within the limits of their
territories, he manifested the inveterate hatred of the Romans
towards Perseus; and this hatred broke out into effect the
sooner, in consequence of king Eumenes coming to Rome, and
bringing with him a written statement of the preparations
made for war, which he had drawn up, after a full inquiry
into every particular. Five ambassadors were now sent to
the king, in order to take a view of affairs in Macedon.
The same were ordered to proceed to Alexandria to Ptolemy,
to renew the treaty of friendship. These were Caius Valerius,
Cneius Lutatius Cerco, Quintus B&aelig;bius Sulca, Marcus
Cornelius Mammula, and Marcus C&aelig;cilius Denter. About
the same time, came ambassadors from king Antiochus; and
the principal of them, called Apollonius, being admitted to an
audience of the senate, presented, on behalf of his king, many
and reasonable apologies for paying the tribute later than the
day appointed. &#8220;He now brought,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the whole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1964" id="Page_1964">Pg 1964</a></span>
it, that the king might require no favour except the delay of
time. He brought besides a present of gold vases, in weight
five hundred pounds. Antiochus requested, that the treaty of
alliance and amity, which had been made with his father,
might be renewed with him; and that the Roman people
might demand from him every service which might be required
from a king who was a good and faithful ally: that he
would never be remiss in the performance of any duty. Such
had been the kindness of the senate towards him when he was
at Rome, such the courtesy of the young men, that, among all
ranks of men, he was treated as a sovereign, not as a hostage.&#8221;
A gracious answer was returned to the ambassadors, and
Aulus Atilius, city pr&aelig;tor, was ordered to renew with Antiochus
the alliance formerly made with his father. The city
qu&aelig;stors received the tribute, and the censors the golden
vases; and the business of placing them in whatever temples
they should judge proper, was assigned to them. &#8220;One hundred
thousand <i>asses</i><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> were presented to the ambassador, and a
house at the public cost was given him for his accommodation,
and it was ordered that his expenses should be paid as long
as he would remain in Italy. The ambassadors, who had
been in Syria, represented him as standing in the highest degree
of favour with the king, and a very warm friend to the
Roman people.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f7" name="f7"></a>7</span>
The following were the events in the provinces during
this year. Caius Cicereius, pr&aelig;tor in Corsica, fought the
enemy in a pitched battle, in which seven thousand of the
Corsicans were slain, and more than one thousand seven hundred
taken. During the engagement the pr&aelig;tor vowed a
temple to Juno Moneta. Peace was then granted to the
Corsicans, on their petitioning for it, and a contribution was
imposed, of two hundred thousand pounds&#8217; weight of wax.
Cicereius crossed over from Corsica, which he had reduced to
subjection, to Sardinia. In Liguria, also, a battle was fought
in the territory of Satiella, at the town of Carystas. A large
army of Ligurians had assembled there, who, for some time
after Marcus Popilius&#8217; arrival, kept themselves within the
walls; but afterwards, when they perceived that the Roman
general would lay siege to the town, they marched out beyond
the gates, and drew up in order of battle. The consul did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1965" id="Page_1965">Pg 1965</a></span>decline an engagement, as that was the object which he endeavoured
to gain by threatening a siege. The fight was
maintained for more than three hours, in such a manner, that
the hope of victory leaned to neither side; but when the consul
perceived that the Ligurian battalions no where gave
ground, he ordered the cavalry to mount their horses, and
charge in three places at once, with all possible violence. A
great part of the horse broke through the middle of the
enemy&#8217;s line, and made their way to the rear of the troops engaged,
owing to which man&#339;uvre, terror was struck into the
Ligurians. They fled in different directions on all sides. Very
few ran back into the town, because in that quarter, chiefly, the
cavalry had thrown themselves in their way. So obstinate a
contest swept off great numbers of the Ligurians, and many
perished in the flight; ten thousand of them are said to have
been killed, and more, than seven hundred taken, in various
places; besides which, the victors brought off eighty-two of
their military standards. Nor was the victory gained without
loss of blood; above three thousand of the conquerors fell in
the conflict; for as neither party gave way, the foremost on
both sides were cut off.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f8" name="f8"></a>8</span>
When the Ligurians re-assembled in one body, after
their scattered flight, they found that a much greater number
of their countrymen were lost than left alive (for there were
not above ten thousand men surviving); on which they surrendered.
They did not stipulate for any terms, yet entertained
hopes that the consul would not treat them with greater
severity than former commanders. But he immediately took
their arms from them, razed their town, and sold themselves
and their effects; and he then sent a letter to the senate, relating
the services which he had performed. When Aulus
Atilius, the pr&aelig;tor, read this letter in the council, (for the other
consul, Postumius, was absent, being employed in surveying
the lands in Campania,) the proceeding appeared to the senate
in a heinous light; &#8220;that the people of Satiella, who alone,
of all the Ligurian nation, had not borne arms against the
Romans, should be attacked, when not offering hostilities, and
even after surrendering themselves in dependence on the protection
of the Roman people, should be butchered and exterminated,
that so many thousands of innocent persons suffering,
who had implored the protection of the Roman people, established
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1966" id="Page_1966">Pg 1966</a></span>
the worst possible precedent, calculated to deter any one
from ever venturing to surrender to them; dragged as the
were away into various parts of the country, and made slaves to
those who were formerly the avowed enemies of Rome, though
now reduced to quiet. That for these reasons the senate ordered,
that the consul, Marcus Popilius, should reinstate the Ligurians
in their liberty, repaying the purchase-money to the
buyers, and should likewise use his best endeavours to recover
and restore their effects. That arms should be made for them,
as soon as possible; and that the consul should not depart
from his province before he restored to their country the
Ligurians that had surrendered. That victory derived its
lustre from conquering the enemy in arms, not from cruelty
to the vanquished.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f9" name="f9"></a>9</span>
The consul exerted the same ferocious spirit in disobeying
the senate, which he displayed towards the Ligurians.
He immediately sent the legions into winter quarters at Pis&aelig;,
and, full of resentment against the senators and the pr&aelig;tor,
went home to Rome; where, instantly assembling the senate
in the temple of Bellona, he used many invectives against
the pr&aelig;tor, who, &#8220;when he ought to have proposed to the
senate that thanksgiving should be offered to the immortal
gods, on account of the happy successes obtained by the Roman
arms, had procured a decree of the senate against him,
in favour of the enemy, by which he might transfer his victory
to the Ligurians; and, though only a pr&aelig;tor, he had
ordered the consul, in a manner, to be surrendered to them:
he therefore gave notice, that he would sue to have him fined.
From the senate he demanded, that they should order the
decree of the senate passed against him to be cancelled; and
that the thanksgiving, which they, though they were far from
him, ought to have voted on the authority of his letter, sent
from abroad, with an account of the success of the arms of
the commonwealth, should, now when he was present, be
voted; first, in consideration of the honour due to the immortal
gods, and next, out of some kind of regard to himself.&#8221;
Being censured to his face no less severely than in his absence,
in the speeches of several of the senators, and having
obtained neither request, he returned to his province. The
other consul, Postumius, after spending the whole summer in
surveying the lands, without even seeing his province, came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1967" id="Page_1967">Pg 1967</a></span>
home to Rome to hold the elections. He appointed Caius
Popillius L&aelig;nas and Publius &AElig;lius Ligus, consuls. Then
Caius Licinius Crassus, Marcus Junius Pennus, Spurius Lucretius,
Spurius Cluvius, Cneius Sicinius, and Caius Memmius,
a second time, were elected pr&aelig;tors.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f10" name="f10"></a>10</span>
The lustrum was closed this year. The censors were
Quintus Fulvius Flaccus and Lucius Postumius Albinus, the
latter of whom performed the ceremony. In this survey were
rated two hundred and sixty-nine thousand and fifteen Roman
citizens. The number was considerably less, because the consul
Lucius Postumius, gave public orders, in assembly, that
none of the Latin allies (who, according to the edict of the
consul, Caius Claudius, ought to have gone home) should be
surveyed at Rome, but all of them in their respective countries.
Their censorship was conducted with perfect harmony
and zeal for the public good. They disfranchised and degraded
from their tribes every one whom they expelled the senate,
or from whom they took away his horse; nor did either approve
a person censured by the other. Fulvius, at this time,
dedicated the temple of Equestrian Fortune, which he had
vowed six years before, and when proconsul in Spain, during
the battle with the Celtiberians; he also exhibited stage-plays,
which lasted four days, in one of which the performance was
in the circus. Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, decemvir in religious
matters, died this year, and Aulus Postumius Albinus
was substituted in his room. Such great crowds of locusts
were suddenly brought by the wind over the sea into Apulia,
that they covered the country far and wide with their swarms.
In order to remove this pest, so destructive to the fruits of
the earth, Caius Sicinius, pr&aelig;tor elect, was sent in command,
with a vast multitude of people assembled, to gather them
up, and spent a considerable time in that business. The beginning
of the year in which Caius Popillius and Publius
&AElig;lius were consuls, was employed in the disputes which had
arisen in the last. The senators were desirous that the
business respecting the Ligurians should be re-considered,
and the decree renewed. &AElig;lius, the consul, was willing
to propose it, but Popillius warmly interceded for his
brother, both with his colleague and the senate; and by giving
notice, that if they would pass any vote on the subject
he would would enter his protest, he deterred him from proceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1968" id="Page_1968">Pg 1968</a></span>
in the matter. The senate being hereby equally incensed
against them, persisted the more obstinately in their intention;
and when they took into consideration the distribution
of the provinces, although Macedon was earnestly sought by
the consuls, because a war with Perseus was daily expected, yet
the Ligurians were assigned as the province of both. They
declare that they would not vote Macedonia to them, unless
the question were put on the affair of Marcus Popilius. The
consuls afterwards demanded that they might be authorized
to raise either new armies, or recruits to fill up the old; both
demands were refused. To the pr&aelig;tors also, when seeking a
reinforcement for Spain, a refusal is given: to Marcus Junius
for Hither Spain, and to Spurius Lucretius for the Farther.
Caius Licinius Crassus obtained by lot the city jurisdiction;
Cneius Sicinius, the foreign; Caius Memmius, Sicily; and
Spurius Cluvius, Sardinia. The consuls, enraged against the
senate on account of this conduct, having proclaimed an early
day for the Latin festival, declared openly that they would
go away to their province, and would not transact any kind
of business, except what belonged to their own government.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f11" name="f11"></a>11</span>
Valerius Antias writes, that, in this consulate, Attalus,
brother to king Eumenes, came to Rome as ambassador, to lay
heavy charges against Perseus, and give an account of his
preparations for war. But the greater number of historians,
and those deemed most worthy of credit, assert, that Eumenes
came in person. Eumenes then, on his arrival, being received
with every degree of respect which the Roman people judged
suitable, not merely to his deserts, but also to their own former
favours, bestowed on him in great abundance, was introduced
to the senate. He said, that &#8220;The cause of his coming to
Rome, besides his wish to visit those gods and men who had
placed him in a situation beyond which he could not presume
to form a wish, was, that he might in person forewarn the
senate to counteract the designs of Perseus.&#8221; Then, beginning
with the projects of Philip, he mentioned his murder of
Demetrius, because that prince was averse to a war with
Rome; that the Bastarnian nation was summoned from their
homes, that, relying on their aid, he might pass over into
Italy. While his thoughts were busied in plans of this
sort, he was surprised by the approach of death, and left
his kingdom to the person whom he knew to be, of all men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1969" id="Page_1969">Pg 1969</a></span>
the bitterest foe to the Romans. &#8220;Perseus therefore,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;having received this scheme of a war, as a legacy bequeathed
by his father, and descending to him along with the crown,
advances and improves it, as his primary object, by every
means that he can devise. He is powerful, in respect of the
number of his young men, since a long peace has produced a
plentiful progeny; he is powerful in respect to the resources
of his kingdom, and powerful, likewise, in respect to his age.
And as, at his time of life, he possesses vigour of body, so
his mind has been thoroughly trained, both in the theory and
practice of war; for even from his childhood he became inured
to it, in his father&#8217;s tent, not only in the wars against
the neighbouring states, but also against the Romans, being
employed by him in many and various expeditions. Already,
since he has received the government, he has, by a wonderful
train of prosperous events, accomplished many things which
Philip, after using his best efforts, could never effect, either
by force or artifice.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f12" name="f12"></a>12</span>
&#8220;There is added to his strength such a degree of influence
as is usually acquired, in a great length of time, by
many and important kindnesses. For, in the several states
throughout Greece and Asia, all men revere the dignity of
his character; nor do I perceive for what deserts, for what
generosity, such uncommon respect is paid him; neither can
I with certainty say whether it occurs through some good fortune
attending him, or whether, what I mention with reluctance
a general dislike to the Romans attaches men to his
interest. Even among sovereign princes he is great by his
influence. He married the daughter of Seleucus, a match
which he did not solicit, but to which he was solicited by her
friends; and he gave his sister in marriage to Prusias, in
compliance with his earnest prayers and entreaties. Both
these marriages were solemnized amidst congratulations and
presents from innumerable embassies, and were escorted by
the most renowned nations, acting as bridal attendants. The
B&#339;otians could never be brought, by all the intrigues of Philip,
to sign a treaty of friendship with him; but now, a treaty
with Perseus is engraved at three different places, at Thebes,
in Delos, in the most venerable and celebrated temple, and at
Delphi. Then, in the diet of Achaia, (only that the proceeding
was quashed by a few persons, threatening them with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1970" id="Page_1970">Pg 1970</a></span>
displeasure of the Roman government,) the business was
nearly effected of allowing him admission into Achaia. But,
as to the honours formerly paid to myself, (whose kindness
to that nation have been such, that it is hard to say whether
my public or private benefactions were the greater,) they have
been lost, partly through neglect, and partly by hostile means
Who does not know that the &AElig;tolians, lately, on occasion of
their intestine broils, sought protection, not from the Romans,
but from Perseus? For, while he is upheld by these alliances
and friendships, he has at home such preparations of every
requisite for war, that he wants nothing from abroad. He
has thirty thousand foot and five thousand horse, and is laying
up a store of corn for ten years, so that he can be independent
of his own territory or that of his enemies with
respect to provisions. He has amassed money to such an
amount, as to have in readiness the pay of ten thousand mercenary
soldiers, besides the Macedonian troops, for the same
number of years, as well as the annual revenue accruing from
the royal mines. He has stored up arms for three times that
number of men; and has Thrace under subjection, from which,
as a never-failing spring, he can draw supplies of young men
if ever Macedon should become exhausted.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f13" name="f13"></a>13</span>
The rest of his discourse contained exhortations to
timely exertions: &#8220;Conscript fathers,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I make these
representations to you, and they are not founded on uncertain
rumours, and too readily believed by me, because I wished such
charges against my enemy to be true; but on a clear discovery
of the facts, as if I had been sent by you to reconnoitre,
and I were now relating what took place before my eyes. Nor
would I have left my kingdom, which you have rendered ample
and highly respectable, and crossed such a tract of sea, to
injure my own credit by offering you unauthenticated reports.
I saw the most remarkable states of Asia and Greece,
every day, gradually unfolding their sentiments, and ready
to proceed, shortly, to such lengths as would not leave them
room for repentance. I saw Perseus, not confining himself
within the limits of Macedonia, but seizing some places by
force of arms, and seducing, by favour and kindness, those
which could not be subdued by force. I perceived the unfair
footing on which matters stood, while he was preparing war
against you, and you bestowing on him the security of peace;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1971" id="Page_1971">Pg 1971</a></span>
although, to my judgment, he did not appear to be preparing,
but rather waging war. He dethroned Abrupolis, your ally
and friend. He put to death Artetarus, the Illyrian, another
ally and friend of yours, because he heard that some information
had been written to you by him. He managed that Eversa
and Callicrates, the Thebans, who were leading men in their state,
should be taken off, because, in the council of the B&#339;otians,
they had spoken with more than ordinary freedom against
him and declared that they would inform you of what was
going on. He carried succour to the Byzantians, contrary to
the treaty. He made war on Dolopia. He overran Thessaly
and Doris with an army, in order to take advantage of the
civil war then raging, and by the help of the party which had
the worst cause to crush the other which had more justice on
its side. He raised universal confusion and disorder in Thessaly
and Perrh&aelig;bia, by holding out a prospect of an abolition
of debts, that, by the means of the multitude of debtors thereby
attached to his interest, he might overpower the nobles.
Since he has performed all these acts with your acquiescence
and silent endurance, and has seen Greece yielded up to him
by you, he firmly believes that he will not meet with one opponent
in arms, until he arrives in Italy. How safe or how
honourable this might be for you, you yourselves may consider;
for my part, I thought it would certainly reflect dishonour on
me, if Perseus should come into Italy to make war, before I,
your ally, came to warn you to be on your guard. Having discharged
this duty, necessarily incumbent on me, and, in some
measure, freed and exonerated my faith; what can I do further,
but beseech the gods and goddesses that you may adopt such
measures as will prove salutary to yourselves, to your commonwealth,
and to us your allies and friends who depend upon you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f14" name="f14"></a>14</span>
His discourse made a deep impression on the senate.
However, for the present, no one, without doors, could know
any thing more than that the king had been in the senate-house,
in such secrecy were the deliberations of the senate
involved; and it was not until after the conclusion of the war,
that the purport of king Eumenes&#8217; speech, and the answer to
it, transpired. In a few days after, the senate gave audience
to the ambassadors of Perseus. But their feelings as well as
their ears were so prepossessed by king Eumenes, that every
plea offered in his justification by the ambassadors, and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1972" id="Page_1972">Pg 1972</a></span>
argument to alleviate the charges against him, were disregarded.
They were still further exasperated by the immoderate
presumption of Harpalus, chief of the embassy, who
said, that &#8220;the king was indeed desirous and even anxious
that credit should be given to him when pleading in his excuse
that he had neither said nor done any thing hostile; but that
if he saw them obstinately bent on finding out a pretence for
war, he would defend himself with determined courage. The
fortune of war was open to all and the issue uncertain.&#8221; All
the states of Greece and Asia were full of curiosity to learn
what the ambassadors of Perseus, and what Eumenes, had
effected with the senate; and most of them, on hearing of the
latter&#8217;s journey to Rome, which they supposed might produce
material consequences, had sent ambassadors thither who pretended
other business. Among the rest came an embassy
from Rhodes, at the head of which was a person named Satyrus,
who had no kind of doubt but that Eumenes had included
his state in the accusations brought against Perseus.
He therefore endeavoured, by every means, through his patrons
and friends, to get an opportunity of debating the matter with
Eumenes in presence of the senate. When he obtained this,
he inveighed against that king with intemperate vehemence,
as having instigated the people of Lycia to an attack on the
Rhodians, and as being more oppressive to Asia than Antiochus
had been. He delivered a discourse flattering indeed,
and acceptable to the states of Asia, (for the popularity of
Perseus had spread even to them,) but very displeasing to the
senate, and disadvantageous to himself and his nation. This
apparent conspiracy against Eumenes, increased, indeed, the
favour of the Romans towards him; so that every kind of
honour was paid, and the most magnificent presents were made
him; among which were a curule chair and an ivory sceptre.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f15" name="f15"></a>15</span>
After the embassies were dismissed, when Harpalus
went back into Macedon with all the haste he could, and told
the king that he had left the Romans, not indeed making immediate
preparations for war, but in such an angry temper,
that it was very evident they would not defer it long; Perseus
himself, who all along believed that this would be the
case, now even wished for it, as he thought himself at the
highest pitch of power that he could ever expect to attain.
He was more violently incensed against Eumenes than against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1973" id="Page_1973">Pg 1973</a></span>
any other; and being desirous of commencing the war with his
bloodshed, he suborned Evander, a Cretan, commander of the
auxiliaries, and three Macedonians, who were accustomed to the
perpetration of such deeds, to murder that king; and gives them
a letter to a woman called Praxo, an acquaintance of his, the
wealthiest and most powerful person at Delphi. It was
generally known that Eumenes intended going up to Delphi
to sacrifice to Apollo. The assassins having reconnoitred the
around with Evander, sought for nothing else than a fit
place to execute their design. On the road from Cirrha to
the temple, before you come to the places thickly inhabited,
there was a wall on the left side of a narrow path projecting
a little from the foundation, by which single persons could pass;
the part on the right formed a precipice of considerable depth
by the sinking of the ground. Behind this wall they concealed
themselves, and raised up steps to it, that from thence,
as from a fortress, they might discharge their weapons on
the king, as he passed by. At first, as he came up from
the sea, he was surrounded by a multitude of his friends and
attendants; afterwards the increasing narrowness of the road
made the train thinner about him. When they arrived at the
spot where each was to pass singly, the first who advanced on
the path was Pantaleon, an &AElig;tolian of distinction, who was at
the time in conversation with the king. The assassins now,
starting up, rolled down two huge stones, by one of which the
head of the king was struck, and by the other the shoulder;
and being stunned by the blow, many stones having been cast
on him after falling, he tumbled from the sloping path down the
precipice. The rest of his friends and attendants, on seeing
him fall, fled different ways; but Pantaleon, with great intrepidity
and resolution, kept his ground, in order to protect
the king.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f16" name="f16"></a>16</span>
The assassins might, by making a short circuit of
the wall, have run down and completed their business; yet
they fled off towards the top of Parnassus with such precipitation,
that as one of them, by being unable to keep up with
the rest through the pathless and steep grounds, retarded
their flight, they killed him lest he should be taken, and a
discovery ensue. The friends, and then the guards and
servants of the king, ran together and raised him up, while
stunned by the wound, and quite insensible. However, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1974" id="Page_1974">Pg 1974</a></span>
perceived, from the warmth of his body, and the breath remaining
in his lungs, that he was still alive, but had little or no
hopes that he would ever recover. Some of his guards having
pursued the tracks of the assassins, when they had reached
even as far as the summit of Parnassus, and had fatigued
themselves in vain, returned without being able to overtake
them. As the Macedonians set about the deed injudiciously
so, after making the attempt with boldness, they
abandoned it in a manner both foolish and cowardly. His
friends on the next day bore to his ship the king, now in possession
of his faculties, and then, having drawn their vessel,
across the neck of the isthmus, they cross over to &AElig;gina.
Here his cure was conducted with such secrecy, his attendants
admitting no one, that a report of his death was carried into
Asia. Attalus also gave more ready credence to it than was
worthy the harmony of brothers; for he talked, both to
Eumenes&#8217; consort, and to the governor of the citadel, as if he
had actually succeeded to the crown. This, afterwards, came
to the knowledge of the king; who, though he had determined
to dissemble, and to pass it over in silence, yet could not refrain,
at their first meeting, from rallying Attalus, on his premature
haste to get his wife. The report of Eumenes&#8217; death
spread even to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f17" name="f17"></a>17</span>
About the same time, Caius Valerius, who had been
sent ambassador to examine the state of Greece, and to observe
the movements of king Perseus, returned from that
country, and made a report of all things, which agreed with
the accusations urged by Eumenes. He brought with him from
Delphi, Praxo, the woman whose house had served as a receptacle
for the assassins; and Lucius Rammius, a Brundusian,
who was the bearer of the following information. Rammius
was a person of the first distinction at Brundusium, accustomed
to entertain in his house the Roman commanders, and
such ambassadors as came that way from foreign powers,
especially those of the kings. By these means he had formed
an acquaintance with Perseus, although he was distant from
him; and in consequence of a letter from him, which gave
hopes of a more intimate friendship, and of great advantages
to accrue to him, he went on a visit to the king, and, in a
short time, found himself treated with particular familiarity,
and drawn, oftener than he wished, into private conversations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1975" id="Page_1975">Pg 1975</a></span>
Perseus, after promises of the highest rewards, pressed him,
with the most earnest solicitations, &#8220;as all the commanders
and ambassadors of the Romans used to lodge at his house, to
procure poison to be given to such of them as he should point
out by letter;&#8221; and told him, that, &#8220;as he knew the preparation
of poison to be attended with the greatest difficulty and
danger, and that ordinarily it could not be administered without
the privity of several; besides, the issue was uncertain,
whether doses sufficiently powerful to produce the desired
effect or calculated to escape detection, might be given;&mdash;he
would, therefore, give him some which neither in administering
nor when administered could be discovered by any means.&#8221;
Rammius dreading, lest, in case of refusal, he should himself
be the first on whom the poison would be tried, promised compliance,
and departed; but did not wish to return to Brundusium,
without first holding a conference with Caius Valerius,
the ambassador, who was said to be at that time in the
neighbourhood of Chalcis. Having first laid his information
before him, by his order he accompanied him to Rome, where,
being brought before the senate, he gave them an account of
what had passed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f18" name="f18"></a>18</span>
These discoveries were added to the information which
had been given by Eumenes, and effected, that Perseus should
the sooner be judged an enemy; as the senate perceived that
he did not content himself with preparing, with the spirit of a
king, for a fair and open war, but pushed his designs by all
the base clandestine means of assassination and poison. The
conduct of the war is conferred on the new consuls; but, in
the mean time, an order was given, that Cneius Sicinius, the
pr&aelig;tor, whose province was the jurisdiction between natives
and foreigners, should raise soldiers who should be led with
all expedition to Brundusium, and thence carried over into
Apollonia in Epirus, in order to secure the cities on the sea-coasts;
in order that the consul, who should have Macedon as
his province, might put in his fleet with safety, and land his
troops with convenience. Eumenes was detained a long time
at &AElig;gina, by a dangerous and difficult cure; but, as soon as
could remove with safety, he went home to Pergamus, and
set on foot the most vigorous preparations for war, since the late
atrocious villany of Perseus now stimulated him, in addition
to the ancient enmity which subsisted between them. Am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1976" id="Page_1976">Pg 1976</a></span>-bassadors
soon came from Rome, with congratulations on his
escape from so great a danger. When the war with Macedon
was deferred to the next year, (the other pr&aelig;tors having
gone away to their provinces,) Marcus Junius and Spurius
Lucretius, to whom the Spanish affairs had fallen, by importuning
the senate with frequent repetitions of the same request
obtained at last that a reinforcement for their army should be
given them, viz. three thousand foot and one hundred and fifty
horse, for the Roman legions; they are ordered to levy, from
the allies, for the confederate troops, five thousand foot and
three hundred horse: these forces were carried by the new
pr&aelig;tors into Spain.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f19" name="f19"></a>19</span>
In the same year, because, in consequence of the inquiries
made by the consul Postumius, a large portion of the
lands of Campania, which had been usurped by private persons
indiscriminately, in various parts, had been recovered to
the public, Marcus Lucretius, plebeian tribune, published a
proposal for an order of the people, that the censors should
let the Campanian land to farm; a measure which had been
omitted during so many years, since the taking of Capua, that
the greediness of individuals might have clear room to work
in. After war, though not yet proclaimed, had been resolved
on, while the senate was anxious to know which of the several
kings would espouse their cause, and which that of Perseus,
ambassadors came to Rome from Ariarathes, bringing with
them his younger son. The purport of their message was,
that &#8220;the king had sent his son to be educated at Rome, in
order that he might even from childhood be acquainted with
the manners and the persons of the Romans; and he requested,
that they would allow him to be not only under the protection
of his particular friends, but likewise the care, and in
some measure the guardianship, of the public.&#8221; This embassy
was highly pleasing to the senate; and they ordered, that
Cneius Sicinius, the pr&aelig;tor, should hire a furnished house for
the accommodation of the young prince and his attendants.
Then that which they sought was given to ambassadors of the
Thracians, who were disputing among themselves, and requesting
the friendship and alliance of the Roman people, and presents
of the amount of two thousand <i>asses</i><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> were sent to each,
for the Romans were rejoiced that these states were gained as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1977" id="Page_1977">Pg 1977</a></span>allies the more so, as they lay at the back of Macedon. But,
in order to acquire a clear knowledge of every thing in Asia and
in the islands, they sent ambassadors, Tiberius Claudius Nero
and Marcus Decimus, with orders to go to Crete and Rhodes,
to renew the treaties of friendship, and at the same time to
observe whether the affections of the allies had been tampered
with by Perseus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f20" name="f20"></a>20</span>
While the minds of the public were in a state of extreme
anxiety and suspense with respect to the impending war, in
consequence of a storm happening in the night the pillar in
the Capitol, ornamented with beaks of ships, <i>which had been
erected</i> in the first Punic war by the consul <i>Marcus &AElig;milius</i>,
whose colleague was Servius Fulvius, was shattered to pieces,
even to the very foundation, by lightning. This event, being
deemed a prodigy, was reported to the senate, who ordered, that
it should be laid before the aruspices, and that the decemvirs
should consult the books. The decemvirs, in answer, directed
that the city should be purified; that a supplication, and
prayers, for the averting of misfortunes should be offered, and
victims of the larger kinds sacrificed both in the Capitol at
Rome, and at the promontory of Minerva in Campania; and
that games should be celebrated as soon as possible in honour
of Jupiter supremely good and great, during ten days. All
these directions were carefully executed. The aruspices answered,
that the prodigy would prove happy in the issue;
that it portended extension of territory and destruction of
enemies; for those beaks of ships which the storm had scattered
were spoils. There were other occurrences which occasioned
religious apprehensions: it was said, that at the town
of Saturnia showers of blood fell during three successive days;
that an ass with three feet was foaled at Calatia; that a bull,
with five cows, were killed by one stroke of lightning; and
that a shower of earth had fallen at Auximum. On account
of these prodigies, also, public worship was performed, and a
supplication and festival observed for one day.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f21" name="f21"></a>21</span>
The consuls had not yet gone to their provinces; for
they would not comply with the senate, in proposing the business
respecting Marcus Popilius; and, on the other hand, the
senate was determined to proceed on no other until that was
done. The general resentment against Popilius was aggravated
by a letter received from him, in which he mentioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1978" id="Page_1978">Pg 1978</a></span>
that he had, as proconsul, fought a second battle with the
Ligurians of Statiella, six thousand of whom he had killed.
On account of the injustice of this attack, the rest of the
states of the Ligurians took up arms. Then not only was
Popilius, in his absence, severely censured in the senate, for
having, contrary to all laws, human and divine, made war on
a people who had submitted to terms, and stirred up to rebellion
states that were disposed to live in peace, but also the
consuls for not having proceeded to that province. Encouraged
by the unanimous opinion of the senators, two plebian
tribunes, Marcus Marcius Sermo and Quintus Marcius
Sylla, declared publicly that they would institute a suit for a
fine to be laid on the consuls, if they did not repair to their
destination. They likewise read before the senate a proposal
for an order of the people respecting the Ligurians, which they
intended to publish. By it a regulation was made, &#8220;that in
case any of the surrendered Statiellans should not be restored
to liberty before the calends of August, then next ensuing,
the senate, on oath, should appoint a magistrate to inquire
into the business, and to punish the person through whose
wicked practices he had been brought into slavery;&#8221; and
accordingly, by direction of the senate, they proclaimed the
same in public. Before the departure of the consuls, the senate
gave audience, in the temple of Bellona, to Caius Cicereius,
pr&aelig;tor of the former year. After recounting what he
had performed in Corsica, he demanded a triumph; but this
being refused, he rode in state on the Alban mount; a mode
of celebration for victory without public authority, which had
now become usual. The people, with universal approbation,
passed and ratified the order proposed by Marcius, respecting
the Ligurians; and in pursuance of this resolution of the
people, Caius Licinius, pr&aelig;tor, desired the senate to appoint
a person to conduct the inquiry, according to the order;
whereupon the senate directed that he himself should conduct
it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f22" name="f22"></a>22</span>
The consuls repaired, at last, to their province, and
received the command of the army from Marcus Popilius.
But the latter did not dare to go home to Rome, lest he might
plead his cause while the senate were so highly displeased
with him, the people still more exasperated, and before a
pr&aelig;tor likewise who had taken the opinion of the senate on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1979" id="Page_1979">Pg 1979</a></span>
an inquiry pointed against him. The tribunes of the people
met his evasion by the menace of another order,&mdash;that if he did
not come into the city of Rome before the ides of November,
Caius Licinius should judge and determine respecting him,
though absent. When he, dragged by this fetter, had returned,
his presence in the senate called forth general hatred.
There, when he was censured by the severe reproaches of
many, a decree was passed, that the pr&aelig;tors, Caius Licinius
and Cneius Sicinius, should take care that such of the Ligurians
as had not been in open arms since the consulate of
Quintus Fulvius and Lucius Manlius, should all be restored
to liberty; and that the consul, Caius Popilius, should assign
them lands on the farther side of the Po. By this decree
many thousands were restored in this manner, led beyond the
Po, and received portions of land accordingly. Marcus Popilius,
being tried by the Marcian law, twice pleaded his cause
before Caius Licinius; but at a third hearing, the pr&aelig;tor,
overcome by his regard for the absent consul, and the prayers
of the Popilian family, ordered the defendant to appear on the
ides of March, on which day the new magistrates were to enter
into office; so that he, being then in a private capacity, could
not preside at the trial. Thus was the order of the people,
respecting the Ligurians, eluded by artifice.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f23" name="f23"></a>23</span>
There were at this time in Rome ambassadors from
Carthage, and also Gulussa, son of Masinissa, between whom
very warm words passed, in presence of the senate. The
Carthaginians complained that, &#8220;besides the district, about
which ambassadors were formerly sent from Rome, to determine
the matter on the spot, Masinissa had, within the last
two years, by force of arms, possessed himself of more than
seventy towns and forts in the Carthaginian territories. This
was easy for him, who cared for nothing. But the Carthaginians,
being tied down by treaty, were silent; for they were
prohibited from carrying arms beyond their own frontiers;
and although they knew that if they forced the Numidians
thence, they would wage the war within their own territory,
yet they were deterred by another clause in the treaty, too
clear to be mistaken, in which they were expressly forbidden
to wage war against the allies of the Roman people. But the
Carthaginians could not longer endure his pride, his cruelty,
and his avarice. &#8220;They were sent,&#8221; they said, &#8220;to beseech the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1980" id="Page_1980">Pg 1980</a></span>
senate to grant them one of these three things: either that
they should fairly decide what belonged to each, as became
an ally of both; or give permission to the Carthaginians to
defend themselves in a just war against unjust attacks; or
finally, if favour swayed more with them than the truth, to
fix at once how much of the property of others they wished
should be bestowed on Masinissa. That the senate would
certainly be more moderate in their grants, and they themselves
would know the extent of them; whereas, he would
set no limits but the arbitrary dictates of his own ambition.
If they could obtain none of these, and if they had, since the
peace granted by Publius Scipio, been guilty of any transgression,
they begged that the Romans themselves would rather
inflict the punishment. They preferred a secure bondage
under Roman masters, to a state of freedom exposed to the
injustice of Masinissa. It was better for them to perish at
once, than to continue to breathe under the will of &#8220;an executioner.&#8221;
After these words, they burst into tears, prostrated
themselves on the ground, and, in this posture, excited both
compassion for themselves, and <i>no less displeasure</i> against
the king.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f24" name="f24"></a>24</span>
It was then voted, that Gulussa should be asked what
answer he had to make to these charges; or that, if it were
more agreeable to him, he should first tell on what business
he had come to Rome. Gulussa said, that &#8220;it was not easy
for him to speak on subjects concerning which he had no instructions
from his father; and that it would have been hard
for his father to have given him instructions, when the Carthaginians
neither disclosed the business which they intended
to bring forward, nor even their design of going to Rome.
That they had, for several nights, held private consultations,
composed of nobles, in the temple of &AElig;sculapius, from whence
ambassadors were despatched with secret information to Rome.
This was his father&#8217;s reason for sending him into Italy, that
he might entreat the senate not to give credit to the common
enemy accusing him, whom they hated for no other cause than
his inviolable fidelity to the Roman people.&#8221; After hearing
both parties, the senate, on the question being put respecting
the demands of the Carthaginians, ordered this answer to be
given, that &#8220;it was their will that Gulussa should, without
delay, return to Numidia, and desire his father to send ambassadors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1981" id="Page_1981">Pg 1981</a></span>
immediately to the senate, to answer the complaints of
the Carthaginians, and to give notice to that people to come
and support their allegation. They had hitherto paid to
Masinissa, and would continue to pay him, all the honour in
their power; that they could not sacrifice justice to favour.
Their wish was, that the lands should every where be possessed
by the real owners; nor did they intend to establish
new boundaries, but that the old ones should be observed.
When they vanquished the Carthaginians, they left them in
possession of cities and lands, not with the purpose of stripping
them by acts of injustice in time of peace of what they
had not taken from them by the right of war.&#8221; With this
answer the Carthaginians, and the prince, were dismissed.
The customary presents were sent to both parties, and the
other attentions which hospitality inquired were performed
with all courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f25" name="f25"></a>25</span>
About this time Cneius Servilius C&aelig;pio, Appius
Claudius Centho, and Titus Annius Luscus, who had been
sent ambassadors to Macedonia, to demand restitution and renounce
the king&#8217;s friendship, returned, and inflamed to a still
greater degree the senate, already predisposed to hostilities
against Perseus, by relating, in order, what they had seen and
heard. They said, that &#8220;through all the cities of Macedonia
they saw preparations for war, carried on with the utmost
diligence. When they arrived at the residence of the king,
they were refused admission to him for many days; at last,
when, despairing of a conference, they were just setting out,
then at length they were called back from their journey and
brought before him. That the leading subjects in their discourse
were, the treaty concluded with Philip, and, after his
father&#8217;s death, renewed with himself; in which he was expressly
prohibited from carrying his arms beyond his own dominions,
and, likewise, from making war on the allies of the
Roman people. They then laid before him, in order, the true
and well-authenticated accounts which they themselves had
lately heard from Eumenes, in the senate. They took notice,
besides, of his having held a secret consultation, in Samothracia,
with ambassadors from the states of Asia; and told
him, that the senate thought proper that satisfaction should
be given for these injuries, as well as restitution, to them and
their allies, of their property, which he held contrary to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1982" id="Page_1982">Pg 1982</a></span>
tenor of the treaty. On this the king, being inflamed, spoke
at first harshly, frequently upbraiding the Romans with pride
and avarice, and with ambassadors coming one after another
to pry into his words and actions; and with thinking proper
that he should speak and do all things in compliance with
their nod and order. After speaking a long time with great
loudness and violence, he ordered them to return the next day,
for he intended to give his answer in writing. Then the
written answer was given to them; of which the purport
was, that the treaty concluded with his father in no respect
concerned him; that he had suffered it to be renewed,
not because he approved of it, but because, being so lately
come to the throne, he had to endure every thing. If they
chose to form a new engagement with him, they ought first to
agree on the terms; if they could bring themselves to make a
treaty on an equal footing, he would consider what was to be
done on his part, and he was convinced that they would provide
for the interests of their own state. After this, he
hastily turned away, and they were desired to quit the palace.
They then declared, that they renounced his friendship and
alliance; at which he was highly exasperated, stopped, and
with a loud voice charged them to quit his dominions within
three days. They departed accordingly; and neither on their
coming, nor while they staid, was any kind of attention or
hospitality shown them.&#8221; The Thessalian and &AElig;tolian ambassadors
were then admitted to audience. It pleased the
senate, that a letter should be sent to the consuls, directing,
that whichever of them was most able should come to Rome
to elect magistrates, in order that they might know what commanders
the state was about to employ.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f26" name="f26"></a>26</span>
The consuls, during that year, performed no business
of the republic that deserved much notice. It appeared more
advantageous to the republic, that the Ligurians, who had
been highly exasperated, should be pacified and appeased.
While a Macedonian war was expected, ambassadors from
Issa gave them reason to suspect the inclinations of Gentius,
king of Illyria; for they complained that &#8220;he had, a second
time, ravaged their country;&#8221; affirming likewise, that &#8220;the
kings of Macedon and Illyria lived on terms of the closest
intimacy; that both were preparing, in concert, for war
against the Romans, and that there were then in Rome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1983" id="Page_1983">Pg 1983</a></span>
Illyrian spies, under the appearance of ambassadors, and who
were sent thither by the advice of Perseus, to ascertain what
was going on.&#8221; The Illyrians, being called before the senate,
said, that they were sent by their king, to justify his conduct,
if the Issans should make any complaint against him. They
were then asked why they had not applied to some magistrate,
that they might, according to the regular practice, be furnished
with lodging and entertainment, that their arrival might be
known, and the business on which they came; when they
hesitated in their reply, they were ordered to retire out of the
senate-house. It was not thought proper to give them any
answer, as delegates, because they had not applied for an audience
of the senate; they resolved, &#8220;that ambassadors should
be sent to the king, to announce to him the complaints made
by the allies of his having ravaged their country; and that
he acted unjustly, since he did not refrain from offering injury
to their allies.&#8221; On this embassy Aulus Terentius Varro,
Caius Pl&aelig;torius, and Caius Cicereius, were sent. The ambassadors,
who had been sent to the several kings in alliance
with the state, came home from Asia, and reported that &#8220;they
had conferred in it with Eumenes; in Syria, with Antiochus;
and at Alexandria, with Ptolemy; all of whom, though
strongly solicited by embassies from Perseus, remained perfectly
faithful to their engagements, and gave assurances of
their readiness to execute every order of the Roman people.
That they had also visited the allied states; that all were firm
in their attachment, except the Rhodians, who seemed to be
wavering, and infected by the counsels of Perseus.&#8221; Ambassadors
had come from the Rhodians, to exculpate them from
the imputations which, they knew, were openly urged against
them; but a resolution was made, that &#8220;an audience of the
senate should be given, when the new magistrates came into
office.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f27" name="f27"></a>27</span>
The senate were of opinion, that the preparations for
war should be deferred no longer. The duty is assigned to
Caius Licinius, that out of the old galleys laid up in the docks
at Rome, which might be rendered serviceable, he should refit
and get ready for sea fifty ships. If any were wanting to
make up that number, that he should write to his colleague,
Caius Memmius, in Sicily, directing him to repair and fit out
such vessels as were in that province, so that they might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1984" id="Page_1984">Pg 1984</a></span>
be sent, with all expedition, to Brundusium. Caius Licinius,
the pr&aelig;tor, was ordered to enlist Roman citizens of the rank of
freed-men&#8217;s sons, to man twenty-five ships; Cneius Sicinius, to
levy, from the allies, an equal number for the other twenty-five,
and likewise to require from the Latin confederates eight
thousand foot and four hundred horse. Aulus Atilius Serranus,
who had been pr&aelig;tor the year before, was commissioned
to receive these troops at Brundusium, and transport them to
Macedon; and Cneius Sicinius, the pr&aelig;tor, to keep them in
readiness for embarkation. By direction of the senate, Caius
Licinius, the pr&aelig;tor, wrote to the consul, Caius Popilius, to
order the second legion, which was the oldest then in Liguria,
together with four thousand foot and two hundred horse, of
the Latin nation, to be in Brundusium on the ides of February,
With this fleet, and this army, Cneius Sicinius, being continued
a year in command for the purpose, was ordered to
take care of the province of Macedon until a new governor
should arrive. All these measures, which the senate voted,
were vigorously executed; thirty-eight quinqueremes were
drawn out of the docks; Lucius Porcius Licinus was appointed
to the command, with directions to conduct them to
Brundusium, and twelve were sent from Sicily; three commissaries
were despatched into Apulia and Calabria, to buy up
corn for the fleet and army; these were Sextus Digitius,
Titus Juventius, and Marcus C&aelig;cilius. When all things
were in readiness, the pr&aelig;tor, Cneius Sicinius, in his military
robes, set out from the city and went to Brundusium.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f28" name="f28"></a>28</span>
The consul, Caius Popilius, came home to Rome when
the year had almost expired, much later than had been directed
by the vote of the senate; to whom it had seemed advantageous
to the republic, that magistrates should be elected
as soon as possible, when so important a war was impending.
Therefore the consul did not receive a favourable hearing
from the senate, when he spoke in the temple of Bellona of
his acts among the Ligurians. There were frequent interruptions
and questions, why he had not restored to liberty the
Ligurians, who had been oppressed by his brother? The
election was held on the day appointed by proclamation, the
twelfth before the calends of March. The consuls chosen
were, Publius Licinius Crassus and Caius Cassius Longinus.
Next day were elected pr&aelig;tors, Caius Sulpicius Galba,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1985" id="Page_1985">Pg 1985</a></span>
Lucius Furius Philus, Lucius Canuleius Dives, Caius Lucretius
Gallus, Caius Caninius Rebilus, and Lucius Villius Annalis.
The provinces decreed to these pr&aelig;tors were, the two
civil jurisdictions in Rome, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia; and
one of them was kept disengaged, that he might be employed
wherever the senate should direct. The senate ordered the
consuls elect, that, on whatever day they would enter on their
office, having sacrificed victims of the larger kind, they should
pray to the gods that the war, which the Roman people intended
to engage in, might prove fortunate in the issue. On
the same day the senate passed an order, that the consul,
Caius Popilius, should vow games, of ten days&#8217; continuance, to
Jupiter supremely good and great, with offerings in all the
temples, if the commonwealth should remain for ten years in
its present state. Pursuant to this vote, the consul made a
vow in the Capitol, that the games should be celebrated, and
the offerings made, at such expense as the senate should direct,
when not less than a hundred and fifty persons were present.
That vow was expressed in terms dictated by Lepidus, the
chief pontiff. There died this year, of the public priests,
Lucius &AElig;milius Papus, decemvir of religious rites, and Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus, a pontiff who had been censor the year
before. The latter died in a shocking manner: he had received
an account, that, of his two sons who were in the army
in Illyria, one was dead, and the other labouring under a
heavy and dangerous malady: his grief and fears, together,
overwhelmed his reason, and his servants, on going into his
chamber in the morning, found him hanging by a rope. There
was a general opinion, that, since his censorship, his understanding
had not been sound; and the report was popular,
that the resentment of Juno Lacinia, for the spoil committed
on her temple, had caused the derangement of his intellects.
Marcus Valerius Messala was substituted decemvir in the
place of &AElig;milius; and Cneius Domitius &AElig;nobarbus, though
a mere youth, was chosen into the priesthood as pontiff in the
room of Fulvius.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f29" name="f29"></a>29</span>
In this consulate of Publius Licinius and Caius Cassius,
not only the city of Rome, but the whole of Italy, with
all the kings and states both in Europe and in Asia, had their
attention fixed on the approaching war between Rome and
Macedon. Not only old hatred, but also recent anger, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1986" id="Page_1986">Pg 1986</a></span>
by the villany of Perseus he had been almost slaughtered
like a victim at Delphi, urged Eumenes against him.
Prusias, king of Bithynia, resolved to keep clear of hostilities,
and to wait the event; for as he did not think it proper to
carry arms on the side of the Romans against his wife&#8217;s
brother, so he trusted that, in case of Perseus proving victorious,
his favour might be secured through the means of
his sister. Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, besides having,
in his own name, promised aid to the Romans, had, ever since
he was allied by affinity to Eumenes, united with him in all
his plans, whether of war or peace. Antiochus indeed entertained
designs on the kingdom of Egypt, since he despised
the unripe age of Ptolemy, and the inactive disposition of his
guardians, and thought that he might, by raising a dispute about
C&#339;lesyria, find sufficient pretext for proceeding to extremities,
and carry on a war there without any impediment, while the
Roman arms were employed against Macedon: yet, by his ambassadors
to the senate, and to their ambassadors sent to him,
he made the fairest promises. Ptolemy, on account of his age,
was then influenced by the will of others; and his guardians,
at the same time while they were preparing for war with
Antiochus, to secure possession of C&#339;lesyria, promised the
Romans every support in the war against Macedon. Masinissa
both assisted the Romans with supplies of corn, and
prepared to send into the field, to their assistance, a body of
troops and a number of elephants, with his son Misagenes.
He so arranged his plans as to answer every event that might
take place; for if success should attend the Romans, he
judged that his own affairs would rest in their present state,
and that he ought to seek for nothing further, as the Romans
would not suffer violence to be offered to the Carthaginians;
and if the power of the Romans, which at that time protected
the Carthaginians, should be reduced, then all Africa
would be his own. Gentius, king of Illyria, had indeed given
cause of suspicion to the Romans; but he had not yet determined
which party to espouse, and it was believed that he
would join either one or the other through some sudden impulse
of passion, rather than from any rational motive. Cotys,
the Thracian king of the Odrysians, was openly in favour of
the Macedonians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f30" name="f30"></a>30</span>
Such were the inclinations of the several kings, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1987" id="Page_1987">Pg 1987</a></span>
the free nations and states the plebeians, favouring as usual
the weaker cause, were almost universally inclined to the
Macedonians and their king; but among the nobles might be
observed different views. One party was so warmly devoted
to the Romans, that, by the excess of their zeal, they diminished
their own influence. Of these a few were actuated by
their admiration of the justice of the Roman government;
but by far the greater number supposed that they would become
powerful in their state, if they displayed remarkable
exertions. A second party wished to court the king&#8217;s favour,
as debt, and despair of their affairs, while the same constitution
remained, urged them hastily to complete revolution; and
others, through a fickleness of temper, followed Perseus as
the more popular character. A third party, the wisest and
the best, wished, in case of being allowed the choice of a
master, to live under the Romans rather than under the king.
Yet, could they have had the free disposal of events, they
wished that neither party should become more powerful by
the destruction of the other, but rather that, the strength of
both being uninjured, peace should continue on that account;
for thus the condition of their states would be the happiest,
as one party would always protect a weak state from any ill
treatment intended by the other. Judging thus, they viewed
in silence from their safe position the contest between the
partisans of the two contending powers. The consuls,
having on the day of their entering on office, in compliance
with the order of the senate, sacrificed victims of the larger
kinds in all the temples where the lectisternium was usually
celebrated for the greater part of the year, and having from
them collected omens that their prayers were accepted by the
immortal gods, reported to the senate that the sacrifices had
been duly performed, and prayers offered respecting the war.
The aruspices declared, that &#8220;if any new undertaking was
intended, it ought to be proceeded in without delay; that
victory, triumphs, and extension of empire were portended.&#8221;
The senate then resolved, that &#8220;the consuls should, on the
first proper day, propose to the people assembled by centuries,&mdash;that
whereas Perseus, son of Philip, and king of Macedon,
contrary to the league struck with his father, and after
Philip&#8217;s death renewed with himself, had committed hostilities
on the allies of Rome, had wasted their lands, and seized their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1988" id="Page_1988">Pg 1988</a></span>
towns, and also had formed a design of making war on the
Roman people, and had for that purpose prepared arms, troops,
and a fleet; unless he gave satisfaction concerning those matters,
that war should be proclaimed against him.&#8221; The question
was carried among the commons. Then a decree of the
senate was passed, that &#8220;the consuls should settle between
themselves, or cast lots, for the provinces of Italy and Macedon;
that the one to whose lot Macedon fell should seek
redress by force of arms from king Perseus, and all who concurred
in his designs, unless they made amends to the Roman
people.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f31" name="f31"></a>31</span>
It was ordered that four new legions should be raised,
two for each consul. This in particular was assigned to the
province of Macedon, that although five thousand foot and
two hundred horse were assigned to the other consul&#8217;s legions,
according to the ancient practice, six thousand foot and three
hundred horse were ordered to be enlisted for each of the
legions that were to serve in Macedonia. Of the allied troops
also, the number was augmented in the army ordered into
Macedon,&mdash;namely, sixteen thousand foot and eight hundred
horse, besides the six hundred horsemen carried thither by
Cneius Sicinius. For Italy, twelve thousand foot and six
hundred horse of the allies were deemed sufficient. The following
remarkable concession was made to the service in
Macedon; the consul was authorized to enlist at his option
veteran centurions and soldiers, as old as fifty years. An
unusual mode of proceeding with regard to the military
tribunes was also introduced on the same occasion: for the
consuls, by direction of the senate, recommended to the people,
that, for that year, the military tribunes should not be
created by their suffrages; but that the consuls and pr&aelig;tors
should exercise their judgment and discrimination in their
selection. Their respective commands were assigned to the
pr&aelig;tors in the following manner: he to whose lot it fell to be
employed wherever the senate should direct, had orders to go
to Brundusium, to the fleet, that he might then review the
crews, and, dismissing such men as appeared unfit for the
service, enlist in their places sons of freed-men, taking care
that two-thirds should be Roman citizens, and the remainder
allies. For supplying provisions to the ships and legions,
from Sicily and Sardinia, it was resolved, that the pr&aelig;tors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1989" id="Page_1989">Pg 1989</a></span>
who obtained the government of those provinces should be
enjoined to levy a second tenth on the Sicilians and Sardinians,
and that this corn should be conveyed into Macedon, to
the army. The lots gave Sicily to Caius Caninius Rebilus;
Sardinia, to Lucius Furius Philus; Spain, to Lucius Canuleius;
the city jurisdiction, to Caius Sulpicius Galba; and the
foreign, to Lucius Villius Annalis. The lot of Caius Lucretius
Gallus was to be employed wherever the senate should
direct.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f32" name="f32"></a>32</span>
The consuls had a slight dispute, rather than a great
contest, about their province. Cassius said, that &#8220;he would
select Macedon without casting lots, nor could his colleague,
without perjury, abide their determination. When he was
pr&aelig;tor, to avoid going to his province, he made oath in the
public assembly, that he had sacrifices to perform on stated
days, in a stated place, and that they could not be duly performed
in his absence; and surely they could no more be
performed duly in his absence when he was consul, than
when he was pr&aelig;tor. If the senate thought proper to pay
more regard to what Publius Licinius wished, in his consulship,
than to what he had sworn in his pr&aelig;torship, he himself,
for his part, would at all events be ruled by that body.&#8221;
When the question was put, the senators thought it would be
a degree of arrogance in them to refuse a province to him,
since the Roman people had not denied him the consulship.
They, however, ordered the consuls to cast lots. Macedonia
fell to Publius Licinius, Italy to Caius Cassius. They then
cast lots for the legions: when it fell to the lot of the first
and third to go over into Macedonia; and of the second and
fourth, to remain in Italy. The consuls held the levy with
much greater care than usual. Licinius enlisted even veteran
centurions and soldiers; and many of them volunteered, as
they saw that those men who had served in the former Macedonian
war, or in Asia, had become rich. When the military
tribunes cited the centurions, and especially those of the
highest rank, twenty-three of them, who had held the first
posts, appealed to the tribunes of the people. Two of
that body, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and Marcus Claudius
Marcellus, wished to refer the matter to the consuls; &#8220;the
cognizance of it ought to rest with those to whom the levy
and the war were intrusted:&#8221; but the rest declared, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1990" id="Page_1990">Pg 1990</a></span>
since the appeal had been made to them, they would examine
into the affair; and, if there were any injustice in the case,
would support their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f33" name="f33"></a>33</span>
The business, therefore, came into the court of the
tribunes. Thither Marcus Popilius, a man of consular dignity,
the centurions, and the consul came. The consul then required
that the matter might be discussed in a general assembly;
and, accordingly, the people were summoned. On the side of
the centurions, Marcus Popilius, who had been consul two
years before, argued thus: that &#8220;as military men they had
served out their regular time, and that they possessed bodies
worn out through age and continual hardships. Nevertheless,
they did not refuse to give the public the benefit of their
services, they only entreated that they might be favoured so
far, that posts inferior to those which they had formerly held
in the army should not be assigned to them.&#8221; The consul,
Publius Licinius, first ordered the decree of the senate to be
read, in which war was determined against Perseus; and then
the other, which directed that as many veteran centurions as
could be procured should be enlisted for that war; and that
no exemption from the service should be allowed to any who
was not upwards of fifty years of age. He then entreated
that, &#8220;at a time when a new war was breaking out so near to
Italy, and with a most powerful king, they would not either
obstruct the military tribunes in making the levies, or prevent
the consul from assigning to each person such a post as best
suited the convenience of the public; and that, if any doubt
should arise in the proceedings, they might refer it to the
decision of the senate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f34" name="f34"></a>34</span>
When the consul had said all that he thought proper,
Spurius Ligustinus, one of those who had appealed to the
plebeian tribunes, requested permission from the consul and
tribunes to speak a few words to the people. By the permission
of them all he spoke, we are told, to this effect: &#8220;Romans,
I am Spurius Ligustinus, of the Crustuminian tribe, and I
sprung from the Sabines. My father left me one acre of land,
and a small cottage, in which I was born and educated, and I
dwell there to-day. As soon as I came to man&#8217;s estate, my
father married me to his brother&#8217;s daughter, who brought
nothing with her but independence and modesty; except,
indeed, a degree of fruitfulness that would have better suited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1991" id="Page_1991">Pg 1991</a></span>
a wealthier family. We have six sons and two daughters;
the latter are both married; of our sons, four are grown up
to manhood, the other two are as yet boys. I became a soldier
in the consulate of Publius Sulpicius and Caius Aurelius. In
the army which was sent over into Macedon I served as a
common soldier, against Philip, for two years; and in the third
year, Titus Quintius Flamininus, in reward of my good conduct,
gave me the command of the tenth company of spearmen.
When Philip and the Macedonians were subdued, and
we were brought back to Italy and discharged, I immediately
went as a volunteer, with the consul Marcus Porcius into Spain.
Those who have had experience of him, and of other generals
in a long course of service, know that no single commander
living was a more accurate observer and judge of merit. This
commander judged me deserving of being set at the head of
the first company of spearmen. A third time I entered as a
volunteer in the army which was sent against the &AElig;tolians
and king Antiochus; and Manius Acilius gave me the command
of the first company of first-rank men. After Antiochus
was driven out of the country, and the &AElig;tolians were reduced,
we were brought home to Italy, where I served the two succeeding
years in legions that were raised annually. I afterwards
made two campaigns in Spain; one under Quintus Fulvius
Flaccus, the other under Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus,
pr&aelig;tors. I was brought by Flaccus among others whom he
brought home from the province to attend his triumph, out of
regard to their good services. At the request of Tiberius
Gracchus, I went with him to his province. Four times within
a few years was I first centurion of my corps; thirty-four times
I was honoured by my commanders with presents for bravery.
I have received six civic crowns, I have fulfilled twenty-two
years of service in the army, and I am upwards of fifty years of
age. But, if I had neither served out all my campaigns, nor
was entitled to exemption on account of my age, yet Publius
Licinius, as I can supply you with four soldiers instead of myself,
it were reasonable that I should be discharged. But I wish
you to consider these words merely as a state of my case; as
to offering any thing as an excuse from service, that is what I
will never do, so long as any officer, enlisting troops, shall
believe me fit for it. What rank the military tribunes may
think I deserve, rests with their power. That no one in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1992" id="Page_1992">Pg 1992</a></span>
army may surpass me in a zealous discharge of duty, I shall
use my best endeavours; and that I have always acted on
that principle, my commanders and my comrades can testify.
And now, fellow-soldiers, you who assert your privilege of
appeal, as you have never, in your youthful days, done any
act contrary to the directions of the magistrates and the senate,
now too you ought to be amenable to the authority of the
senate and consuls, and to think every post honourable in
which you can act for the defence of the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f35" name="f35"></a>35</span>
Having finished his speech, he was highly commended
by the consul, who led him from the assembly into the senate-house,
where, by order of the senate, he again received public
thanks; and the military tribunes, in consideration of his
meritorious behaviour, made him first centurion in the first
legion. The rest of the centurions, dropping the appeal, submissively
answered to their names in the levy. That the
magistrates might the sooner go into their provinces, the
Latin festival was celebrated on the calends of June; and as
soon as that solemnity was ended, Caius Lucretius, the pr&aelig;tor,
after sending forward every thing requisite for the fleet, went
to Brundusium. Besides the armies which the consuls were
forming, Caius Sulpicius Galba, the pr&aelig;tor, was commissioned
to raise four city legions, with the regular number of foot and
horse, and to choose out of the senate four military tribunes
to command them; likewise, to require from the Latin allies
fifteen thousand foot, with twelve hundred horse; that this
army should be prepared to act wherever the senate should
order. At the desire of the consul, Publius Licinius, the
following auxiliaries were ordered to join the army of citizens
and allies under his command: two thousand Ligurians; a
body of Cretan archers (whose number was not specified, the
order only mentioning whatever succours the Cretans, on
being applied to, should send); likewise the Numidian
cavalry and elephants. To settle concerning these last, ambassadors
were sent to Masinissa and the Carthaginians,&mdash;Lucius
Postumius Albinus, Quintus Terentius Culleo, and
Caius Aburius: also, to Crete,&mdash;Aulus Postumius Albinus,
Caius Decimius, and Aulus Licinius Nerva.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f36" name="f36"></a>36</span>
At this time arrived ambassadors from Perseus. It
was the pleasure of the fathers that they should not be permitted
to come into the city; as the senate had already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1993" id="Page_1993">Pg 1993</a></span>
decreed; and the people had ordered, a declaration of war
against their king and the Macedonians. Being introduced
before the senate in the temple of Bellona, they spoke in the
following manner: that &#8220;king Perseus wondered what could
be their motive for transporting troops into Macedon; and
that if the senate could be prevailed on to recall them, the
king would, at their arbitration, satisfactorily account for any
injuries of which their allies might complain.&#8221; Spurius Carvilius
had been sent home from Greece, by Cneius Sicinius, for
the purpose of attending this business, and was present in the
senate. He charged the king with taking military occupation
of Perrh&aelig;bia, storming several cities of Thessaly, and other
enterprises, in which he was either actually employed or preparing
to engage; and the ambassadors were called on to
answer to those points. After they declined to do so, declaring
that they had no further instructions, they were
ordered to tell their king, that &#8220;the consul Publius Licinius
would soon be in Macedon at the head of an army. To
him he might send ambassadors, if he were disposed to give
satisfaction, but there was no use in his sending any more to
Rome; for none of them would be permitted to pass through
Italy.&#8221; After they were thus dismissed, a charge was given
to Publius Sicinius, to insist on their quitting Italy within
eleven days, and to send Spurius Carvilius to guard them,
until they embarked. Such were the transactions at Rome,
before the departure of the consuls for their provinces. Cneius
Sicinius, who, before the expiration of his office, had been
sent to Brundusium to the fleet and army, had by this time
transported into Epirus five thousand foot and three hundred
horse, and was encamped at Nymph&aelig;um, in the territory of
Apollonia. From which place he sent tribunes, with two
thousand men, to take possession of the forts of the Dassaretians
and Illyrians; as those people themselves solicited
garrisons, to secure them from the inroads of the Macedonians
in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f37" name="f37"></a>37</span>
A few days after, Quintus Marcius, Aulus Atilius,
Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Servius Cornelius Lentulus, and
Lucius Decimius, who were sent ambassadors to Greece, carried
with them one thousand soldiers to Corcyra; where they
divided the troops among them, and settled what districts they
were to visit. Decimius was sent to Gentius, king of Illyria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1994" id="Page_1994">Pg 1994</a></span>
with instructions to sound him, as to whether he retained any
regard for former friendship; and even to prevail on him to take
part in the war. The two Lentuluses were sent to Cephallenia
that they might cross over from it into Peloponnesus; and,
before the winter, make a circuit round the western coast. The
circuit of Epirus, &AElig;tolia, and Thessaly is intrusted to Marcius
and Atilius; they were directed to take a view afterwards
of B&#339;otia and Eub&#339;a, and then to pass over to Peloponnesus,
where, by appointment, they were to meet the Lentuluses.
Before they set out on their several routes from Corcyra, a
letter was brought from Perseus, in which he inquired the
reason of the Romans sending troops into Greece, and taking
possession of the cities. They did not think proper to give
him any answer in writing; but they told his messenger, who
brought the letter, &#8220;for the sake of guarding the cities themselves.&#8221;
The Lentuluses, going round the cities of Peloponnesus,
after exhorting all the states, without distinction, as
they had assisted the Romans with fidelity and spirit, first
in the war with Philip, and then in that with Antiochus, to
assist them now, in like manner, against Perseus, heard some
murmuring in the assemblies; for the Ach&aelig;ans were highly
offended that they, who, from the very first rise of the war
with Macedon, had given every instance of friendship to the
Romans, and had been open enemies to the Macedonians in
the war with Philip, should be treated on the same footing
with the Messenians and Elians, who had borne arms on the
side of Antiochus against the Roman people, and who, being
lately incorporated in the Ach&aelig;an union, made heavy complaints,
as if they were made over to the victorious Ach&aelig;ans
as a prize.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f38" name="f38"></a>38</span>
When Marcius and Atilius went up to Gitan&aelig;, a town
of Epirus, about ten miles from the sea, a council of Epirotes
being held there, they were listened to with universal approbation;
and they sent thence four hundred young men of that
country to Orest&aelig;, to protect those whom they had freed from
the dominion of the Macedonians. From this place they proceeded
into &AElig;tolia; where, having waited a few days, until
a pr&aelig;tor was chosen, in the room of one who had died, and
the election having fallen on Lyciscus, who was well known
to be a friend to the interest of the Romans, they passed over
into Thessaly. The envoys of the Acarnanians and the exiles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1995" id="Page_1995">Pg 1995</a></span>
of the B&#339;otians came thither. The Acarnanians had orders
to represent that &#8220;whatever offences they had been guilty of
towards the Romans, first in the war with Philip, and afterwards
in that with Antiochus, in consequence of being misled
by the professions of those kings, they had found an opportunity
to expiate. Since in spite of their demerits they had
experienced the clemency of the Roman people, so they would
now, by their endeavours to merit favour, make trial of its
generosity.&#8221; The B&#339;otians were upbraided with having
united themselves in alliance with Perseus; but they threw
the blame on Ismenias, the leader of a party, and alleged, that
&#8220;several states were drawn into that measure, contrary to
their own judgment:&#8221; to which Marcius replied, that &#8220;this
would appear, as they intended to give to every one of the
states the power of judging for itself.&#8221; The council of the
Thessalians was held at Larissa. There too the Thessalians
had a wide field for giving thanks to the Romans for the blessing
of liberty conferred on them; and the ambassadors, because
they had been vigorously assisted by the Thessalians
in the wars with Philip and Antiochus. The feelings of the
assembly were acted on by this mutual acknowledgment of favours
to such a degree that they voted every measure which the
Romans wished. Soon after this meeting, ambassadors arrived
from king Perseus, chiefly through reliance on a connexion of
hospitality subsisting between him and Marcius, which had
existed between their fathers. The ambassadors began by
reminding him of this bond of amity, and then requested him
to give the king an opportunity of conferring with him.
Marcius answered, that &#8220;he had received from his father the
same account of the friendship and hospitable connexion between
him and Philip; and the consideration of that connexion
induced him to undertake the present embassy. That he
would not have so long delayed giving the king a meeting,
could it have been done without inconvenience; and that now
he and his colleague would, as soon as it should be in their
power, come to the river Peneus, where the passage was from
Omolium to Dium; messengers being previously sent to announce
it to the king.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f39" name="f39"></a>39</span>
Perseus, on this, withdrew from Dium into the heart
of the kingdom, having conceived a slight inspiration of hope
from the expression of Marcius, that he had undertaken the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1996" id="Page_1996">Pg 1996</a></span>
embassy out of regard to him. After a few days they all met
at the appointed place. The king&#8217;s suite was a large one, since
a crowd of friends attended him, as well as his body-guards.
The ambassadors came with a train not inferior in numbers, as
many accompanied them from Larissa, and also the delegates
of many states, who had met them there, wishing to carry
home information on the positive testimony of what they
themselves should hear. All men felt a strong curiosity to
behold a meeting between so powerful a king, and the ambassadors
of the first people in the world. After they came
within sight, on the opposite sides of the river, some time was
spent in sending messengers from one to the other, to settle
which of the two should cross it; for one party thought the
compliment due to royal majesty, the other to the fame of the
Roman people, especially as Perseus had requested the conference.
Marcius by a jest roused them from their delay:&mdash;&#8220;Let
the younger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;cross over to the elder; the son
to the father:&#8221; for his own surname was Philip. The king
was easily persuaded to comply; but then another perplexity
arose, about the number he should bring over with him. He
thought it would be proper to be attended by his whole retinue;
but the ambassadors required that he should either come with
three attendants only, or if he brought so great a band, that
he should give hostages that no treachery should be used
during the conference. He accordingly sent as hostages
Hippias and Pantaucus, two of his particular friends, and
whom he had sent as ambassadors. The hostages were demanded
not so much to get a pledge of good faith, as to
make it apparent to the allies, that the king did not meet
the ambassadors on a footing of equal dignity. Their salutations
were not like those between enemies, but kind and
friendly; and seats being placed for them, they sat down together.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f40" name="f40"></a>40</span>
After a short silence, Marcius began thus:&mdash;&#8220;I suppose
you expect us to give an answer to your letter sent to
Corcyra, in which you ask the reason, why we ambassadors
come attended by soldiers, and why we send garrisons into
the cities? To this your question I dread either to refuse an
answer, lest it should appear haughty in me, or to give a true
one, lest, to your ears, it might seem too harsh. But since
the person who infringes a treaty must be reproved, either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1997" id="Page_1997">Pg 1997</a></span>
with words or with arms, as I could wish that the war against
you had been intrusted to any other rather than to myself, so I
will undergo the task, however disagreeable, of uttering rough
language against my friend, as physicians, when they, for the
recovery of health, sometimes apply painful remedies. The
senate is of opinion that, since you came to the throne, you
have acted but in one particular as you ought to have done,
and that is, in sending ambassadors to Rome to renew <i>the
treaty made with your father,&mdash;and yet it would have been
better never to have renewed it</i>, (they think,) than afterwards
to violate it. You expelled from his throne Abrupolis, an ally
and friend of the Roman people. You gave refuge to the
murderers of Artetarus, that it might appear that you were
pleased at his assassination, to say nothing worse; though
they put to death a prince, who, of all the Illyrians, was the
most faithful to the Roman nation. You marched with an
army through Thessaly and the Italian territory to Delphi,
contrary to the treaty. You likewise, in violation of it, sent
succours to the Byzantians. You concluded by an oath a
separate alliance with the B&#339;otians our confederates, which
you had no right to do. As to Eversa and Callicritus, the
Theban ambassadors, who were slain in returning from Rome,
I wish rather to inquire who were their murderers, than to
charge any one of the crime. To whom else than your agents
can the civil war in &AElig;tolia, and the deaths of the principal
inhabitants, be imputed? The country of the Dolopians was
ravaged by you in person. King Eumenes, when he was returning
from Rome to his own dominions, was almost butchered,
as a victim, at the altars in consecrated ground, at
Delphi, and it grieves me to know the person whom he
accuses. With regard to the secret crimes which the host at
Brundusium states in his communication, I take it for certain,
that all the particulars were written you from Rome, and that
your ambassadors reported them to you. There was one way
by which you might have avoided my speaking of these matters,
which was, by not inquiring why we brought troops into
Macedonia, or sent garrisons into the cities of our allies.
When you had asked the question, it would have been more
haughty to keep silence, than to answer according to truth.
Out of regard to the friendship derived to us from our fathers,
I am really disposed to listen favourably to whatever you may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1998" id="Page_1998">Pg 1998</a></span>
say, and wish that you may afford me some grounds of pleading
your cause before the senate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f41" name="f41"></a>41</span>
To this the king answered,&mdash;&#8220;A cause which would
approve itself good if tried before impartial judges, I must
plead before judges who are at the same time my accusers.
Of the circumstances laid to my charge, some are of such a
nature that I know not whether I ought not to glory in
them; others there are which I would not blush to confess;
and others, which as they are backed by bare assertions, it will
be sufficient to deny. Supposing that I were this day to
stand a trial, according to your laws, what does either the
Brundusian informer, or Eumenes, allege against me that would
be deemed a well-founded accusation, and not rather a malicious
aspersion? Had Eumenes (although both in his public
and private capacity he has done many grievous injuries to so
many people) no other enemy than me? Could I not find a
better agent for the perpetration of wickedness than Rammius,
whom I had never seen before, nor had any probability
of ever seeing again? Then, I must give an account of the
Thebans, who, it is well known, perished by shipwreck; and
of the death of Artetarus, with regard to whom nothing more
is alleged against me, than that his murderers lived in exile
in my dominions. I will not object to the injustice of this
assumption, provided you will admit it on your side; and will
acknowledge that, whatever exiles have taken refuge in Rome
or in Italy, you are yourselves abettors of the crimes for
which they have been condemned. If you admit not this
principle, as other nations will not, neither will I. In truth,
what advantage were it to any one that exile lay within his
grasp, if no where was there room for an exile? As soon however
as I understood from your representations, that those
men were in Macedon, I ordered that search should be made
for them, and that they should quit the kingdom; and I prohibited
them for ever from setting foot on my dominions.
These accusations are brought against me as if I were a
criminal pleading my cause; the others affect me as a king,
and must derive their decision from the treaty which exists
between you and me. For if it is thus expressed in that
treaty, that even if any one would wage war against me, I am
not permitted to protect my kingdom; I must then confess I
have infringed it, by defending myself with arms against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1999" id="Page_1999">Pg 1999</a></span>
Abrupolis, an ally of the Roman people. But, on the other
hand, if it is both allowed by the treaty, and is an axiom
established by the law of nations, that arms may be repelled
by arms; how, I pray you, ought I to have acted when Abrupolis
had spread devastation over the frontiers of my kingdom
as far as Amphipolis, carried off great numbers of free persons
a vast multitude of slaves, and many thousands of cattle?
Ought I to have lain quiet, and let him proceed until he
came in arms to Pella, into my very palace? But, allowing
that I avenged my wrongs in a just war, yet he ought not to
have been subdued, and made to suffer the evils which occur
to the vanquished. Nay, but when I, who was the person
attacked, underwent the hazard of all these, how can he, who
was the cause of the war, complain if they happened to fall
upon himself? As to my having punished the Dolopians by
force of arms, I mean not, Romans, to defend myself in the
same manner; because, whether they deserved that treatment
or not, I acted in right of my own sovereign authority: for
they were under my sovereign power and dominion, annexed
to my father&#8217;s territories by your decree. Nor, even if I were
to give an account of my conduct, I do not say to you, nor my
other confederates, but even to such as disapprove of a severe
and unjust exercise of authority, even over slaves, would I
appear to have carried my severity against them beyond the
limits of justice and equity; for they slew Euphranor, the
governor whom I had set over them, in such a manner, that
death was the slightest of his sufferings.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f42" name="f42"></a>42</span>
&#8220;But, when I proceeded to visit Larissa, Antron, and
Pteleos, (that I might be within a convenient distance to pay
vows, due long before,) I went up to Delphi, in order to offer
sacrifice; and here, with the purpose of aggravating the imputed
guilt, it is subjoined, that I went with an army, with
intent to do what I now complain of your doing,&mdash;to seize the
towns, and put garrisons in the citadels. Now, call together,
in assembly, the states of Greece, through which I marched; and
if any one person complain of ill treatment, offered by a soldier
of mine, I will not deny that I may appear, under a pretence of
sacrificing, to have had a different object. We sent aid to the
&AElig;tolians and Byzantians, and made a treaty of friendship
with the B&#339;otians. These proceedings, of whatever nature
they may be, have been repeatedly avowed by my ambassadors;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2000" id="Page_2000">Pg 2000</a></span>
and, what is more, excused before your senate, where
I had several of my judges not so favourable as you, Quintus
Marcius, my paternal friend and guest. But at that time, my
accuser, Eumenes, had not come to Rome; one who, by misrepresenting
and distorting every occurrence, rendered it
suspicious and odious, and endeavoured to persuade you that
Greece could not be in a state of freedom, nor enjoy your
kindness, while the kingdom of Macedon subsisted. The
wheel will come round; people will soon be found who will
insist, that Antiochus was in vain removed beyond the mountains
of Taurus; that Eumenes is more burdensome to Asia
than Antiochus was; and that your allies can never enjoy
peace so long as there is a palace at Pergamus: for this was
raised as a citadel over the heads of the neighbouring states.
Quintus Marcius and Aulus Atilius, I am aware that the
charges which were made by you, and my reply to them, will
have just so much weight as the ears and the tempers of the
hearers are disposed to allow them to have; and that the question
what I have done, or with what intention, is not of so much
importance, as what construction you may put on what has been
done. I am conscious to myself that I have not, knowingly,
done wrong; and that, if I have done any wrong, erring through
imprudence, I am capable of receiving correction and reformation
from these reproofs. I have certainly committed no fault
that is incurable, or deserving punishment by war and plunder:
for surely the fame of your clemency and consistency of conduct,
spread over the world, is ill-founded, if, on such causes
as are scarcely deserving of complaint or expostulation, you
take up arms against kings in alliance with you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f43" name="f43"></a>43</span>
As he uttered these words with the apparent approbation
of the ambassadors, Marcius advised him to send ambassadors
to Rome, as he thought it best to try every expedient
to the last, and to omit nothing that might afford any prospect
of peace. The consideration still remained, how the ambassadors
might travel with safety; and although, to this end, it
was necessary that the king should ask a truce, which Marcius
wished for, and in fact had no other view in consenting to the
conference, yet he granted it with apparent reluctance, and as
a great favour to the persons requesting it. At that juncture
the Romans had not made sufficient preparations for war;
they had no army, no general: whereas Perseus had every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2001" id="Page_2001">Pg 2001</a></span>
thing prepared and ready; and if a delusive hope of peace had
not blinded his judgment, he might have commenced hostilities
at a time most advantageous to himself and distressing
to his enemies. At the breaking up of this conference, (the
truce being ratified by both parties,) the Roman ambassadors
bent their route towards B&#339;otia, where great commotions
were now beginning; for several of the states withdrew
themselves from the union of the general confederacy of the
B&#339;otians, from the time that the answer of the ambassadors
was announced, that &#8220;it would appear what particular states
were displeased at the formation of the alliance with the king.&#8221;
First deputies from Ch&aelig;ronea, then others from Thebes, met
the Romans on the road, and assured them, that they were
not present in the council wherein that alliance was resolved
on. The ambassadors, giving them no answer at the time, ordered
that they should go with them to Chalcis. At Thebes
a violent dissension arose out of another contest. The party
defeated in the election of pr&aelig;tors of B&#339;otia, resolving to revenge
the affront, collected the multitude, and passed a decree
at Thebes, that the new B&#339;otarchs should not be admitted into
the cities. All the persons thus exiled betook themselves
to Thespi&aelig;; being recalled from it (for they were received
there without hesitation) to Thebes, owing to a change in the
minds of the people, they passed a decree that the twelve
persons who, without being invested with public authority,
had held an assembly and council, should be punished by
banishment: and afterwards the new pr&aelig;tor, (he was Ismenias,
a man of distinction and power,) by another decree,
condemns them, although absent, to capital punishment.
They had fled to Chalcis; and thence they proceeded to Larissa,
to the Romans, and threw on Ismenias alone the blame
of the alliance concluded with Perseus, asserting that the contest
originated in a party dispute; yet ambassadors from both
sides waited on the Romans, as did the exiles, accusers of
Ismenias, and Ismenias himself.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f44" name="f44"></a>44</span>
When they were all arrived at Chalcis, the chiefs of
the other states, each by a particular decree of their own, renounced
the alliance of Perseus, and joined themselves to the
Romans, a circumstance which gave very great pleasure to the
latter. Ismenias recommended, that the B&#339;otian nation
should be placed under the orders of Rome; on which so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2002" id="Page_2002">Pg 2002</a></span>
violent a dispute arose, that, if he had not fled for shelter to
the tribunal of the ambassadors, he would not have been far
from losing his life by the hands of the exiles and their abettors.
Thebes itself, the capital of B&#339;otia, was in a violent
ferment, one party struggling hard to bring the state over to
the king, the other to the Romans; and multitudes had come
together, from Coron&aelig; and Haliartus, to support the decree
in favour of Perseus. But by the firmness of the chiefs, (who
desired them to judge, from the defeats of Philip and Antiochus,
how great must be the power and fortune of the Roman
empire,) the same multitude was overcome, and not only resolved
that the alliance with the king should be cancelled, but
also, to gratify the ambassadors, sent the promoters of that
alliance to Chalcis; and ordered, that the state should be
recommended to the protection of the Romans. Marcius and
Atilius heard the Thebans with joy, and advised both them
and each state separately to send ambassadors to Rome to
renew the treaty. They required, above all things, that the
exiles should be restored; and condemned by their own
decree the advisers of the treaty with the king. Having thus
disunited the members of the B&#339;otian council, which was
their grand object, they proceeded to Peloponnesus, after
summoning Servius Cornelius to Chalcis. An assembly was
summoned to meet them at Argos, where they demanded
nothing more from the Ach&aelig;ans, than the furnishing of one
thousand soldiers, which were sent as a garrison to defend
Chalcis until a Roman army should come into Greece.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f45" name="f45"></a>45</span>
Marcius and Atilius having finished the business that
was to be done in Greece, returned to Rome in the beginning
of winter. An embassy had been despatched thence, about
the same time, into Asia, to the several islands. The ambassadors
were three; Tiberius Claudius, Publius Postumius,
and Marcus Junius. These, making a circuit among the
allies, exhorted them to undertake the war against Perseus, in
conjunction with the Romans; and the more powerful any
state was, the more earnestly they requested them, judging
that the smaller states would follow the lead of the greater.
The Rhodians were esteemed of the utmost consequence on
every account; because they could not only countenance the
war, but also assist in it by their own strength, having, pursuant
to the advice of Hegesilochus, forty ships ready for sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2003" id="Page_2003">Pg 2003</a></span>
This man being chief magistrate, whom they call Prytanis,
had, by many arguments, prevailed on the Rhodians to banish
the hope of courting the favour of kings, which they had, in
repeated instances, found fallacious; and to maintain firmly
the alliance with Rome (which was the only one in the earth
that could be relied on for strength or honour). He told
them, that &#8220;a war was upon the point of breaking out with
Perseus: that the Romans would expect the same naval armament
which they had seen lately in that with Antiochus, and
formerly in that with Philip: that they would be hurried, in
the hasty equipment of a fleet, when it ought to be sent at
once, unless they immediately set about the repairing and
manning of their ships: and that they ought to do this with
the greatest diligence, in order to refute, by the evidence of
facts, the imputations thrown on them by Eumenes.&#8221; Roused
by these arguments, they showed to the Roman ambassadors,
on their arrival, a fleet of forty ships rigged and fitted out, so
that it might appear that they did not require to be urged.
This embassy had great effect in conciliating the affections of
the states in Asia. Decimius alone returned to Rome without
effecting any thing, and disgraced by the suspicion of having
received money from the Illyrian kings.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f46" name="f46"></a>46</span>
When Perseus, after the conference with the Romans,
had retired into Macedon, he sent ambassadors to Rome to
carry on the negotiation for peace commenced with Marcius,
giving them letters, to be delivered at Byzantium and Rhodes.
The purport of the letters to all was the same, viz. that he had
conferred with the Roman ambassadors. What he had heard
from them, and what he had said, was, however, represented in
such a manner that he might seem to have had the advantage
in the debate. In presence of the Rhodians, the ambassadors
added, that &#8220;they were confident of a continuation of peace,
for it was by the advice of Marcius and Atilius that they
were sent to Rome. But if the Romans should commence
their hostilities, contrary to treaty, it would then be the
business of the Rhodians to labour, with all their power and
all their interest, for the re-establishment of peace; and that,
if they should effect nothing by their mediation, they ought
then to take such measures as would prevent the dominion of
the whole world from coming into the hands of one nation
only. That, as this was a matter of general concern, so it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2004" id="Page_2004">Pg 2004</a></span>
was peculiarly interesting to the Rhodians, as they surpassed
the other states in dignity and power, which must be held on
terms of servility and dependence, if there were no other
resource for redress than the Romans.&#8221; Both the letter and the
discourse of the ambassadors were received by the Rhodians
with every appearance of kindness, but by no means exerted
any influence in working a change in their minds, for by this
time the best-judging party had the superior influence. By a
public order this answer was given:&mdash;that &#8220;the Rhodians
wished for peace; but, if war should take place, they hoped
that the king would not expect or require from them any
thing that might break off their ancient friendship with the
Romans, the fruit of many and great services performed on
their part both in war and peace.&#8221; The Macedonians, on
their way home from Rhodes, visited also the states of B&#339;otia.
Thebes, Coron&aelig;a, and Haliartus; for it was thought that the
measure of abandoning the alliance with the king, and joining
the Romans, was extorted from them against their will. The
Thebans were not influenced by his representations, though
they were somewhat displeased with the Romans, on account
of the sentence passed on their nobles, and the restoration of
the exiles; but the Coron&aelig;ans and Haliartians, out of a kind
of natural attachment to kings, sent ambassadors to Macedon,
requesting the aid of a body of troops to defend them against
the insolent tyranny of the Thebans. To this application the
king answered, that, &#8220;on account of the truce concluded with
the Romans, it was not in his power to send troops; but he
recommended to them, to guard themselves against ill-treatment
from the Thebans, as far as they were able, without
affording the Romans a pretext for venting their resentment
on him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f47" name="f47"></a>47</span>
When Marcius and Atilius returned to Rome, they reported
in the Capitol the result of their embassy, in such a
manner that they assumed no greater merit for any one
matter, than for having overreached the king by the suspension
of arms, and the hope of peace given him; for &#8220;he was
so fully provided,&#8221; they said, &#8220;with every requisite for the immediate
commencement of war, while on their side no one thing
was in readiness, that all the convenient posts might have
been preoccupied by him before an army could be transported
into Greece; but, by gaining so much time by the truce, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2005" id="Page_2005">Pg 2005</a></span>
Romans would begin the war better provided with every
thing; whereas he would come into the field in no respect
better prepared.&#8221; They mentioned, also, that &#8220;they had so
effectually disunited by stratagem the members of the B&#339;otian
council, that they could never again, with any degree of unanimity,
connect themselves with the Macedonians.&#8221; A great
part of the senate approved of these proceedings, as conducted
with consummate wisdom; but the older members, and those
who retained the ancient simplicity of manners, declared, that
&#8220;in the conduct of that embassy, they could discover nothing of
the Roman genius. Their ancestors waged war not by stratagems
and attacks in the night, nor by counterfeiting flight and
returning unexpectedly on an unguarded foe, nor in such a
manner as to glory in cunning more than in real valour. That
they were accustomed to proclaim war before they waged it,
that they sometimes appointed the day of battle and marked
out the ground on which they were to fight. That with the
same honourable feeling information was given to king Pyrrhus
of his physician plotting against his life; and, from the same
motive, they delivered bound, to the Faliscians, the betrayer
of their children. These were the acts of the Roman law,
not resulting from the craft of Carthaginians or the subtlety
of Greeks, among whom it is reckoned more glorious to deceive
an enemy than to overcome him by force. Sometimes
greater present advantages may be acquired by artifice than
by bravery. But an adversary&#8217;s spirit is finally subdued for
ever, when the confession has been extorted from him, that
he was vanquished, not by artifice, nor by chance, but in a
just and open war, in a fair trial of strength hand to hand.&#8221;
Such were the sentiments of the elder members, to whom
this modern kind of wisdom was displeasing. But that part
of the senate who paid more regard to utility than to honour,
prevailed, and passed a vote approving of Marcius&#8217; conduct
in his former embassy; at the same time ordering that he
should be sent again into Greece with some ships, and with
authority to act in other matters as he should judge most conducive
to the public good. They also sent Aulus Atilius to
keep possession of Larissa in Thessaly; fearing lest, on the
expiration of the armistice, Perseus might send troops and
secure to himself that metropolis. For the execution of this,
Atilius was ordered to receive from Cneius Sicinius two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2006" id="Page_2006">Pg 2006</a></span>
thousand infantry. And three hundred soldiers of the Italian
race were given to Publius Lentulus, who had returned from
Achaia, that he should fix his quarters at Thebes, in order
that B&#339;otia might be kept in obedience.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f48" name="f48"></a>48</span>
After these preparations were made, the senate, notwithstanding
their determination for war was fixed, yet judged
it proper to give audience to the king&#8217;s ambassadors. Their
discourse was, principally, a repetition of what had been urged
by Perseus in the conference. The accusation of laying the
ambush against Eumenes was defended with the greatest care,
and yet with the least success, for the thing was manifest.
The rest consisted of apologies: but their hearers were not
in a temper to be either convinced or persuaded. Orders
were given them to quit the city of Rome instantly, and Italy
within thirty days. Then orders were given to Publius
Licinius, the consul, to whose lot the province of Macedon
had fallen, to appoint as early as possible the day for assembling
the army. Caius Lucretius, the pr&aelig;tor, whose province
was the fleet, sailed from the city with forty quinqueremes;
for it was judged proper that some of the vessels that were repaired
should be kept at Rome for other exigencies. The pr&aelig;tor
sent forward his brother, Marcus Lucretius, with one quinquereme;
ordering him to collect from the allies the ships due
by treaty, and to join the fleet at Cephalonia. He received
from the Rhegians one trireme, from the Locrians two, and
from the Urites four; and then, coasting along the shore of
Italy, until he passed the farthest promontory of Calabria, in
the Ionian Sea, he shaped his course over to Dyrrachium.
Finding there ten barks belonging to the Dyrrachians, twelve
belonging to the Iss&aelig;ans, and fifty-four to king Gentius,
affecting to understand that they had been brought thither
for the use of the Romans, he carried them all off, and sailed
in three days to Corcyra, and thence directly to Cephalonia.
The pr&aelig;tor Caius Lucretius set sail from Naples, and, passing
the strait, arrived on the fifth day at Cephalonia. There the
fleet halted, waiting until the land forces should be carried
over, and until the transport vessels, which had been separated
from the fleet and scattered over the sea, might rejoin it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f49" name="f49"></a>49</span>
About this time the consul Publius Licinius, after offering
vows in the Capitol, marched out of the city in his military
robes. This ceremony is always conducted with great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2007" id="Page_2007">Pg 2007</a></span>
dignity and solemnity; on this occasion particularly, it engaged
people&#8217;s eyes and thoughts in an unusual degree,&mdash;and this, by
reason that they escorted the consul against an enemy formidable
and conspicuous both for abilities and resources. For
not only their desire to pay him the customary respect, but
an earnest wish to behold the show, and see the commander,
to whose wisdom and conduct they intrusted the maintenance
of the public safety, brought them together. Then such reflections
as these entered their minds: &#8220;How various were
the chances of war; how uncertain the issue of the contest;
how variable the success of arms; how frequent the vicissitudes
of losses and successes; what disasters often happened
through the unskilfulness and rashness of commanders; and
on the contrary, what advantages their judgment and valour
conferred. What human being could yet know either the
capacity or the fortune of the consul whom they were sending
against the enemy; whether they were shortly to see him at
the head of a victorious army ascending the Capitol in triumph,
to revisit the same gods from whom he now took his
departure, or whether they were to give a like cause of exultation
to their enemies.&#8221; Then king Perseus, against whom
he was going, had a high reputation, derived from the great
martial character of the Macedonian nation, and from his
father Philip, who, besides many prosperous achievements,
had gained a large share of renown even in his war with the
Romans. Besides too, the name of Perseus himself, which
had never ceased, since his accession to the throne, to be the
subject of conversation, owing to the expectation of the war.
Two military tribunes, of consular rank, Caius Claudius and
Quintus Mucius, were sent with him; and three illustrious
young men, Publius Lentulus, and two of the name of Manlius
Acidinus, one the son of Marcus Manlius, the other of
Lucius. With these he went to Brundusium to the army;
and sailing over thence with all his forces, pitched his camp
at Nymph&aelig;um, in the territory of Apollonia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f50" name="f50"></a>50</span>
A few days before this, Perseus, after the ambassadors
returned from Rome, and cut off every hope of peace, held a
council, in which a contest was carried on for some time between
different opinions. Some were of opinion that he
ought to pay a tribute, or even to cede a part of his dominions,
if they should deprive him of that; in short, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2008" id="Page_2008">Pg 2008</a></span>
ought not to refuse, for the sake of peace, whatever must be
submitted to, nor act in such a manner as would expose himself
and his kingdom to such a perilous hazard. For, &#8220;if he
retained undisputed possession of the throne, time and the
revolution of affairs might produce many conjunctures, which
would enable him not only to recover his losses, but to become
formidable to those whom he now had reason to dread.&#8221;
A considerable majority, however, expressed sentiments of a
bolder nature. They insisted that &#8220;the cession of any part
would be followed by that of the whole kingdom. The Romans
were in want of neither money nor territory: but they
considered that all human affairs, even kingdoms and empires
are subject to many casualties. They had themselves broken
the power of the Carthaginians, and settled in the neighbourhood
a very powerful king, as a yoke on their necks, and had
removed Antiochus and his future successors beyond the mountains
of Taurus. There now remained only the kingdom of
Macedonia near in situation, and such as might, if any where
the fortune of Rome should waver, inspire its kings with the
spirit of their forefathers. Perseus therefore ought, while his
affairs were yet in a state of safety, to consider well in his
own mind, whether he should prefer to give up one part of
his dominions after another, until at length, stripped of all
power and exiled from his kingdom, he should be reduced to
beg from the Romans either Samothracia or some other island,
where he might grow old in poverty and contempt; or, on
the other hand, armed in vindication of his fortune and his
honour, as is the part of a brave man, either should endure
with patience whatever misfortune the chance of war might
bring upon him, or by victory deliver the world from the
tyranny of Rome. There would be nothing more wonderful
in the Romans being driven out of Greece, than in Hannibal&#8217;s
being driven out of Italy; nor, in truth, did they see how it
could consist with the character of the prince, to resist with
the utmost vigour his brother, who unjustly aspired to the
crown, and, after he had fairly obtained it himself, surrender
it up to foreigners. Lastly, that war had its vindication as
well as peace, so that nothing was accounted more shameful
than to yield up a dominion without a struggle, and nothing
more glorious than for a prince to have experienced every kind
of fortune in the defence of his crown and dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2009" id="Page_2009">Pg 2009</a></span>
<span class="lsidenote"><a id="f51" name="f51"></a>51</span>
The council was held at Pella, in the old palace of the
Macedonian kings. &#8220;Let us then,&#8221; Perseus said, &#8220;with the
help of the gods, wage war, since that is your opinion;&#8221;
and, despatching letters to all the commanders of the troops,
he concentrated his entire force at Cytium, a town of Macedon.
He himself, after making a royal offering of one
hundred victims, which he sacrificed to Minerva, called Alcidemos,
set out for Cytium, attended by a band of nobles and
guards. All the forces, both of the Macedonians and foreign
auxiliaries, had already assembled in that place. He encamped
them before the city, and drew them all up, under arms, in
order of battle, in a plain. The amount of the whole was
forty-three thousand armed men; of whom about one half
composed the phalanx, and were commanded by Hippias of
Ber&#339;a; there were then two thousand selected for their superior
strength, and the vigour of their age, out of the whole
number of their shield-bearers: this legion they called, in their
own language, Agema, and the command of them was given to
Leonatus and Thrasippus of Eulyea. Antiphilus of Edessa
commanded the rest of the shield-bearers, about three thousand
men. P&aelig;onians, and men from Parorea and Parstrymonia,
(places subject to Thrace,) with Agrians, and a mixture of
some native Thracians, made up the number of about three
thousand men. Didas, the P&aelig;onian, the murderer of young
Demetrius, had armed and embodied these. There were two
thousand Gallic soldiers, under the command of Asclepiodotus;
three thousand independent Thracians, from Heraclea, in the
country of the Sintians, had a general of their own. An equal
number nearly of Cretans followed their own general, Susus
of Phalasarna, and Syllus of Gnossus. Leonidas, a Laced&aelig;monian,
commanded a body of five hundred Greeks, of various
descriptions: this man was said to be of the royal blood, and
had been condemned to exile in a full council of the Ach&aelig;ans
on account of a letter to Perseus, which was intercepted.
Lycho, an Ach&aelig;an, was the commander of the &AElig;tolians and
B&#339;otians, who did not make up more than the number of five
hundred men. These auxiliaries, composed of so many states
and so many nations, made up about twelve thousand fighting
men. Of cavalry, he had collected from all parts of Macedon,
three thousand: and Cotys, son of Seutha, king of the
Odrysian nation, was arrived with one thousand chosen horsemen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2010" id="Page_2010">Pg 2010</a></span>
and nearly the same number of foot. The total number
was thirty-nine thousand foot, and four thousand horse. Most
certainly, since the army which Alexander the Great led into
Asia, no king of Macedonia had ever been at the head of so
powerful a force.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f52" name="f52"></a>52</span>
It was now twenty-six years since peace had been
granted to the suit of Philip; and Macedon, having through
all that period enjoyed quiet, was become exceedingly populous,
and very many were now grown up, and become qualified
for the duties of the field; and owing to the unimportant wars
with the neighbouring states of Thrace, which had given them
exercise rather than fatigue, were in continual practice of
military service. Besides, a war with Rome having been long
meditated by, first, Philip, and afterwards by Perseus, had
effected that all things should be arranged and prepared. The
troops performed some few movements, but not the regular
course of exercise, only that they might not seem to have stood
motionless under arms. He then called them, armed as they
were, to an assembly. He himself stood on his tribunal, with his
two sons, one on each side of him; the elder of whom, Philip,
was by birth his brother, his son by adoption; the younger,
named Alexander, was his son by birth. The king exhorted
his troops to a vigorous prosecution of the war. He enumerated
the injuries offered by the Romans to Philip and himself;
told them, that &#8220;his father, having been compelled, by every
kind of indignity, to resolve on a renewal of hostilities, was,
in the midst of his preparations for war, arrested by fate:
that ambassadors were sent by himself at the same time that
soldiers were sent to seize the cities of Greece: that then,
under the pretext of re-establishing peace, they spun out the
winter, by means of a fallacious conference, in order to gain
time to make their preparations; that their consul was now
coming, with two Roman legions, containing each six thousand
foot and three hundred horse, and nearly the same number of
auxiliaries; and that, should they even be joined by the troops
of Eumenes and Masinissa, yet these could not amount to
more than seven thousand foot and two thousand horse.&#8221; He
desired them, &#8220;after hearing the number of the enemy&#8217;s forces,
to reflect on their own army, how far it excelled both in number
and in the qualifications of the men, a body of raw recruits,
enlisted hastily for the present occasion; whereas they themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2011" id="Page_2011">Pg 2011</a></span>
had from childhood been instructed in the military art,
and had been disciplined and inured to toil in a course of many
wars. The auxiliaries of the Romans were Lydians, Phrygians,
and Numidians; while his were Thracians and Gauls,
the bravest nations in the world. Their troops had such
arms as each needy soldier procured for himself; but those
of the Macedonians were furnished out of the royal stores,
and had been made with much care at the expense of his father,
in a course of many years. They must bring their provisions
not only from a great distance, but expose them to all
the hazards of the sea; while he, besides his revenue from the
mines, had laid up a store, both of money and food, sufficient
for the consumption of ten years. The Macedonians possessed
in abundance every advantage, in point of preparation, that
depended on the kindness of the gods, or the care of their
sovereign: they ought therefore to have the same daring
spirit which their fathers had before them; who, after subduing
all Europe, passed over into Asia, and opened by their
arms a world unknown to fame, and never ceased to conquer
until they were stopped by the Red Sea, and when nothing
remained for them to subdue. But in truth fortune has determined
the present struggle to be carried on, not for the far
remote regions of India, but for the possession of Macedon
itself. When the Romans made war on his father, they held
out the specious pretence of liberating Greece; now, they
avowedly aimed at reducing Macedon to slavery, that there
might be no king in the neighbourhood of the Roman empire,
and that no nation, renowned in war, should have the possession
of arms; for these must be delivered up to their imperious
masters, together with the king and kingdom, if they chose to
decline a war, and obey their orders.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f53" name="f53"></a>53</span>
Notwithstanding that, during the course of his speech,
he was frequently interrupted by the exclamations of the
multitude; then truly such shouts arose from the army, expressing
indignation and menaces against the foe, and urging
him to act with spirit, that he put an end to his discourse.
He only ordered them to be ready to march; because it was
reported that the Romans were quitting their camp at Nymph&aelig;um;
and then, dismissing the assembly, he went to give
audience to deputies from the several states of Macedon,
who were come to offer money and corn, in proportion to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2012" id="Page_2012">Pg 2012</a></span>
abilities of each. He gave thanks to all, but declined their
proffers; telling them that the royal stores were sufficient to
answer every purpose. Carriages only were demanded for
the conveyance of the engines, and the vast quantity of
missile weapons that was prepared, with other military implements.
He then put his army in motion, directing his
route to Eordea; and after encamping at the lake Begorites,
advanced, next day, into Elimea, to the river Haliacmon.
Then passing the mountains through a narrow defile
called Cambunii, he marched against the inhabitants of the
district called Tripolis, consisting of Azoras, Pythios, and
Doliche. These three towns hesitated, for a little time, because
they had given hostages to the Lariss&aelig;ans; however
being overcome by the fear of immediate danger, they capitulated.
He received them with expressions of favour, not
doubting that the Perrh&aelig;bians would be induced to follow
their example; and accordingly, on his first arrival he got
possession of their city, without any reluctance being shown
on the part of the inhabitants. He was obliged to use force
against Cyreti&aelig;, and was even repulsed the first day by bodies
of armed men, who defended the gates with great bravery;
but on the day following, having assaulted the place with all
his forces, he received their surrender before night.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f54" name="f54"></a>54</span>
Mylas, the next town, was so strongly fortified, that the
inhabitants, from the hopes of their works being impregnable,
had conceived too great a degree of confidence. Not content
with shutting their gates against the king, they cast insulting
reproaches on himself and on the Macedonians, which behaviour,
while it provoked the enemy to attack them with
greater rancour, kindled a greater ardour in themselves
to make a vigorous defence, as they had now no hopes of
pardon. During three days, therefore, the town was attacked
and defended with great spirit. The great number
of Macedonians made it easy for them to relieve each other,
and to support the fight by turns; not only wounds, but want
of sleep and continual labour, were wearing out the besieged,
who guarded the walls by day and night. On the fourth day,
when the scaling-ladders were raised on all sides, and one of
the gates was attacked with unusual force, the townsmen, who
were beaten off the walls, ran together to secure the gate, and
made a sudden sally. Since this was the effect rather of inconsiderate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2013" id="Page_2013">Pg 2013</a></span>
rage than of a well-grounded confidence in their
strength, they being few in number, and worn down with
fatigue, were routed by men who were fresh; and having
turned their backs, and fled through the open gate, they
allowed the enemy to enter through it. The city was
thus taken, and plundered, and even the persons of free
condition who survived the carnage were sold. The king,
after dismantling and reducing to ashes the greater part of
the town, removed, and encamped at Phalanna; and next day
arrived at Gyrton; but understanding that Titus Minucius
Rufus, and Hippias, the pr&aelig;tor of the Thessalians, had gone
into the town with a body of troops, he passed by, without even
attempting a siege, and received the submission of Elatia and
Gonni, whose inhabitants were dismayed by his unexpected
arrival. Both these towns, particularly Gonni, stand at the
entrance of the pass which leads to Tempe; he therefore left
the latter under a strong guard of horse and foot, and fortified
it, besides, with a triple trench and rampart. Advancing to
Sycurium, he determined to wait there the approach of the
Romans; at the same time he ordered his troops to collect
corn from all parts of the country subject to the enemy: for
Sycurium stands at the foot of Mount Ossa, the southern side
of which overlooks the plains of Thessaly, and the opposite
side Macedonia and Magnesia. Besides these advantages of
situation, the place enjoys a most healthful air, and a never-failing
supply of water, from the numerous springs which lay
around.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f55" name="f55"></a>55</span>
About the same time the Roman consul, marching
towards Thessaly, at first found the roads of Epirus clear and
open; but afterwards, when he proceeded into Athamania,
where the country is rugged, and almost impassable, with
great labour and by short marches he with difficulty reached
Gomphi. If, while he was leading his raw troops through
such a territory, and while both his men and horses were debilitated
by constant toil, the king had attacked him with his
army in proper order, and at an advantageous place and time,
the Romans themselves do not deny that they must have suffered
very great loss in an engagement. When they arrived
at Gomphi, without opposition, great contempt of the enemy
was added to their joy at having effected their passage through
such a dangerous road, since they showed such utter ignorance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2014" id="Page_2014">Pg 2014</a></span>
of their own advantages. The consul, after duly offering sacrifice,
and distributing corn to the troops, halted a few days, to
give rest to the men and horses; and then, hearing that the
Macedonians were overrunning Thessaly, and wasting the
country of the allies, he led on to Larissa his troops, now sufficiently
refreshed. Proceeding thence, when he came within
about three miles of Tripolis, (they call the place Sc&aelig;a,) he encamped
on the river Peneus. In the mean time, Eumenes arrived
by sea at Chalcis, accompanied by his brothers Attalus
and Athen&aelig;us, (bringing with him two thousand foot, the
command of whom he gave to the latter,) having left his other
brother, Philet&aelig;rus, at Pergamus to manage the business of his
kingdom. From thence, with Attalus and four thousand foot
and one thousand horse, he came and joined the consul: two
thousand foot were left at Chalcis, of which Athen&aelig;us had the
command: whither also arrived parties of auxiliaries from every
one of the states of Greece; but most of them so small that
their numbers have not been transmitted to us. The Apollonians
sent three hundred horse and one hundred foot. Of the
&AElig;tolians came a number equal to one cohort, being the entire
cavalry of the nation; and of the Thessalians (all their cavalry
acted separately) not more than three hundred horsemen were
in the Roman camp. The Ach&aelig;ans furnished one thousand
young men, armed mostly in the Cretan manner.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f56" name="f56"></a>56</span>
In the mean time, Caius Lucretius, the pr&aelig;tor and
naval commander at Cephallenia, having ordered his brother,
Marcus Lucretius, to conduct the fleet along the coast of
Malea to Chalcis, went himself on board a trireme, and sailed
to the Corinthian gulf, that he might as early as possible put
the affairs of B&#339;otia on a proper footing; but the voyage
proved tedious to him, particularly from the weak state of his
health. Marcus Lucretius, on his arrival at Chalcis, when he
heard that Haliartus was besieged by Publius Lentulus, sent
a messenger to him, with an order, in the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s name, to
retire from the place. The lieutenant-general, who had undertaken
this enterprise with B&#339;otian troops, raised out of the
party that sided with the Romans, retired from the walls.
But the raising of this siege only made room for a new one:
for Marcus Lucretius immediately invested Haliartus with
troops from on board the fleet, amounting to ten thousand
effective men, and who were joined by two thousand of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2015" id="Page_2015">Pg 2015</a></span>
forces of king Eumenes, who were under Athen&aelig;us. Just when
they were preparing for an assault, the pr&aelig;tor came up from
Creusa. At the same time, ships sent by the allies arrived at
Chalcis: two Carthaginian quinqueremes, two triremes from
Heraclea in Pontus, four from Chalcedon, a like number from
Samos, and also five quinqueremes from Rhodes. The pr&aelig;tor
sent back these to the allies, because there was no where a
naval war. Quintus Marcius also came to Chalcis with his
ships, having taken Alope, and laid siege to Larissa, called
likewise Cremaste. While such was the state of affairs in
B&#339;otia, Perseus, when, as has been mentioned, he lay encamped
at Sycurium, after collecting the corn from all the
adjacent parts, sent a detachment to ravage the lands of the
Pher&aelig;ans; hoping that the Romans might be drawn away
from their camp to succour the cities of their allies, and then
be caught at a disadvantage. And when he saw that they
were not put in motion by this disorderly expedition, he distributed
all the booty, consisting mostly of cattle of all kinds,
among the soldiers, that they might feast themselves with
plenty. The prisoners he kept.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f57" name="f57"></a>57</span>
Both the consul and the king held councils nearly at the
same time, to determine in what manner they should begin
their operations. The king assumed fresh confidence, from
the enemy having allowed him, without interruption, to
ravage the country of the Pher&aelig;ans: and in consequence, resolved
to advance directly to their camp, and give them no
further time for delay. On the other side, the Romans were
convinced that their inactivity had created a mean opinion of
them in the minds of their allies, who were exceedingly
offended that aid was not borne to the Pher&aelig;ans. While
they were deliberating how they should act, (Eumenes and
Attalus were present in the council,) a messenger in a violent
hurry acquainted them that the enemy were approaching in
a great body. On this the council was dismissed, and an
order to take arms instantly issued. It was also resolved,
that in the mean time a party of Eumenes&#8217; troops, consisting
of one hundred horse, and an equal number of javelin-bearers
on foot, should go out to observe the enemy. Perseus, about
the fourth hour of the day, being nearly one thousand paces
from the Roman camp, ordered the body of his infantry to
halt and advanced himself in front, with the cavalry and light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2016" id="Page_2016">Pg 2016</a></span>
infantry, accompanied by Cotys and the other generals of the
auxiliaries. They were less than five hundred paces distant,
when they descried the Roman horse, which consisted of two
cohorts, mostly Gauls, commanded by Cassignatus, and
attended by about one hundred and fifty light infantry, Mysians
and Cretans. The king halted, as he knew not the force
of the enemy. He then sent forward two troops of Thracians,
and two of Macedonians, with two cohorts of Cretans and
Thracians. The fight, as the parties were equal in number,
and no reinforcements were sent upon either side, ended without
any decided advantage. About thirty of Eumenes&#8217; men
were killed, among whom fell Cassignatus, general of the
Gauls. Perseus then led back his forces to Sycurium, and
the next day, about the same hour, brought up his army to
the same ground, and a number of waggons carrying water
followed him; for the road for twelve miles had no water, and
was very full of dust: and it was apparent that if they came
to an engagement on the first view of the enemy, they would
be greatly distressed in the fight by thirst. When the Romans
remained quiet, and even called in the advanced guards
within the rampart; the king&#8217;s troops returned to their camp.
In this manner they acted for several days, still hoping that
the Roman cavalry might attack their rear on their retreat,
which would bring on a battle; considering, likewise, that
when they had once enticed the Romans to some distance
from their camp, they could, being superior in both cavalry
and light infantry, easily, and in any spot, face about upon
them.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f58" name="f58"></a>58</span>
After this design did not succeed, the king moved his
camp nearer the enemy, and fortified it at the distance of five
miles from the Romans. From it at the dawn of the next
day, having drawn up his line of infantry on the same ground
as before, he led up the whole cavalry and light infantry to
the enemy&#8217;s camp. The sight of the dust rising in great
abundance and nearer than usual, caused a great alarm in the
Roman camp; and at first they scarcely believed the person
announcing the circumstance, because during all the preceding
days the Macedonians had never appeared before the
fourth hour, and it was now only sun-rise. Afterwards, when
their doubts were removed, by the shouting of great numbers,
and the men running off from the gates, great confusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2017" id="Page_2017">Pg 2017</a></span>
ensued. The tribunes, pr&aelig;fects, and centurions hastened to
the general&#8217;s quarters, and their soldiers to their several tents.
Perseus formed his troops within less than five hundred paces
of the rampart, round a hill, called Callinicus. King Cotys,
at the head of his countrymen, had the command of the left
wing, the light infantry were placed between the ranks of the
cavalry and separated them. On the right wing were the Macedonian
horse, with whose troops the Cretans were intermixed.
Milo, of Ber&#339;a, had the command of these last; Meno, of
Antigone, that of the cavalry, and the chief direction of the
whole division. Next to the wings were posted the royal
horsemen, and a mixed kind of troops selected out of the
auxiliary corps of many nations; the commanders here were
Patrocles of Antigone, and Didas the governor of P&aelig;onia.
In the centre was the king; and on each side of him the band
called Agema, with the consecrated squadrons of horse; in
his front the slingers and javelin-bearers, each body amounting
to four hundred. The command of these he gave to Ion
of Thessalonice, and Timanor, a Dolopian. The king&#8217;s troops
were posted in this manner. On the other side, the consul,
drawing up his infantry in a line within the trenches, sent
out likewise all his cavalry and light infantry, which were
marshalled on the outside of the rampart. Caius Licinius
Crassus, the consul&#8217;s brother, had the command of the right
wing, which consisted of all the Italian cavalry, with light infantry
intermixed. On the left wing, Marcus Valerius L&aelig;vinus
commanded the cavalry of the allies, being sent by the states of
Greece, and the light infantry of the same nation; Quintus
Mucius, with a chosen body of cavalry, levied on the emergency,
led the centre. In the front of this body were placed
two hundred Gallic horsemen; and of the auxiliaries of
Eumenes, three hundred Cyrtians. Four hundred Thessalian
horse were posted at a little distance, beyond the left wing.
King Eumenes and Attalus, with their whole division, stood
on the rear, between the rear rank and the rampart.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f59" name="f59"></a>59</span>
Formed in this manner, and nearly equal in numbers
of cavalry and light infantry, the two armies encountered;
the fight being begun by the slingers and javelin-bearers, who
preceded the lines. First of all the Thracians, just like wild
beasts which had been long pent up, rushing on with a
hideous yell, fell upon the Italian cavalry in the right wing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2018" id="Page_2018">Pg 2018</a></span>
with such fury, that even those men who were fortified
against fear, both by experience in war and by their natural
courage, were thrown into disorder. The footmen struck
their spears with their swords; sometimes cut the hams of
their horse, and sometimes stabbed them in the flanks. Perseus,
making a charge on the centre, at the first onset routed
the Greeks. When the enemy pressed hard on their rear, the
Thessalian cavalry, who had been posted in reserve at a little
distance from the left wing, clear of the shock, at first mere
spectators of the fight, afterwards, when affairs took this unfortunate
turn, were of the utmost service to the Greeks. For
they retreating leisurely, and keeping their ranks, after they
joined the auxiliary troops under Eumenes, in concert with
him afforded a safe retreat between their ranks to the confederates,
who fled in disorder, and as the enemy did not
follow in close bodies, they even had the courage to advance,
and by that means saved many of the flying soldiers who
made towards them. Nor did the king&#8217;s troops, who in the
ardour of the pursuit had fallen into confusion, dare to encounter
men regularly formed, and marching with a steady
pace. When the king, victorious in the cavalry action,
shouted out &#8220;that the war was finished, if they would aid
him by even slight exertions,&#8221; the phalanx came up seasonably
while he was encouraging his troops; for Hippias
and Leonatus, as soon as they heard of the victory gained
by the horse, without waiting for orders, advanced with all
haste, that they might be at hand to second any spirited
design. While the king, struck with the great importance of
the attempt, hesitated between hope and fear, Evander, the
Cretan, who had been employed by him to waylay king
Eumenes at Delphi, after he saw the body of infantry advancing
round their standards, ran up, and warmly recommended,
to him, &#8220;not to suffer himself to be so far elated by
success, as rashly to risk his all on a precarious chance, when
there was no necessity for it. If he would content himself
with the advantage already obtained, and proceed no farther
that day, he would have it in his power to make an honourable
peace; or if he chose to continue the war, he would be
joined by abundance of allies, who would readily follow fortune.&#8221;
The king&#8217;s own judgment rather inclined to this plan;
wherefore, after commending Evander, he ordered the standards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2019" id="Page_2019">Pg 2019</a></span>
to be borne back, and the infantry to return to their
camp, and the trumpeters to sound the signal for retreat to
the cavalry. On the side of the Romans there were slain that
day two hundred horsemen, and not less than two thousand
footmen; about two hundred horsemen were made prisoners:
but of the king&#8217;s, only twenty horsemen and forty footmen
were killed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f60" name="f60"></a>60</span>
When the victors returned to their camp, all were full
of joy, but the insolent transports of the Thracians were particularly
remarkable; for on their way back they chanted
songs, and carried the heads of the enemy fixed on spears.
Among the Romans there was not only grief arising from
their ill success, but dread lest the enemy should immediately
attack their camp. Eumenes advised the consul to take post
on the other side of the Peneus, that he might have the river
as a defence, until the dismayed troops should recover their
spirits. The consul was deeply struck with the shame of an
acknowledgment of fear; yet he yielded to reason, and leading
over his troops in the dead of the night, fortified a camp on
the farther bank. Next day the king advanced with the intention
of provoking the enemy to battle; and on seeing their camp
pitched in safety on the other side of the river, admitted that
he had been guilty of error in not pushing the victory the day
before, and of a still greater fault, in lying idle during the
night; for by sending his light-armed troops, without calling
out any of his other soldiers, the army of the enemy might in
a great measure be destroyed, during their confusion in the
passage of the river. The Romans were delivered, indeed,
from any immediate fears, as they had their camp in a place
of safety; but, among many other afflicting circumstances,
their loss of reputation affected them most. In a council held
in presence of the consul, every one concurred in throwing
the blame on the &AElig;tolians, insisting that the panic and flight
took place first among them; and that then the other allied
troops of the Grecian states followed their cowardly example.
Five chiefs of the &AElig;tolians, who were said to be the first
persons that turned their backs, were sent to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f61" name="f61"></a>61</span>
The Thessalians were publicly commended in a general
assembly, and their commanders even received presents for
their good behaviour. The spoils of the enemies who fell in
the engagement were brought to the king, out of which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2020" id="Page_2020">Pg 2020</a></span>
made presents,&mdash;to some, of remarkable armour, to some, of
horses, and to others he gave prisoners. There were above
one thousand five hundred shields; the coats of mail and
breastplates amounted to more than one thousand, and the
number of helmets, swords, and missile weapons of all sorts
was much greater. These spoils, ample in themselves, were
much magnified in a speech which the king made to an assembly
of the troops: he said, &#8220;You have given the prestige of
victory to the issue of the war: you have routed the best part
of the enemy&#8217;s force, the Roman cavalry, which they used to
boast of as invincible. For, with them, the cavalry is the
flower of their youth; the cavalry is the nursery of their
senate; out of them they choose the members of that body,
who afterwards are made their consuls; out of them they
elect their commanders. The spoils of these we have just
now divided among you. Nor have you a less evident victory
over their legions of infantry, who, stealing away in the
night through fear of you, filled the river with all the disorderly
confusion of people shipwrecked, swimming here and
there. But it will be easier for us to pass the Peneus in pursuit
of the vanquished, than it was for them in the hurry of
their flight; and, immediately on our passing, we will assault
their camp, which we should have taken this morning if they
had not run away. Or if they should choose to meet us in
the field, anticipate the same result in an infantry action, as
took place yesterday when the cavalry were engaged.&#8221;
Those troops who had gained the victory, while they bore on
their shoulders the spoils of the enemies whom they had
killed, were highly animated at hearing their own exploits,
and, from what had passed, conceived sanguine hopes of the
future; while the infantry, especially those of the Macedonian
phalanx, were inflamed with emulation of the glory acquired
by the others, wishing impatiently for an opportunity to
display their exertions in the king&#8217;s service, and to acquire
equal glory from the defeat of the enemy. The king then
dismissed the assembly; and next day, marching thence,
pitched his camp at Mopsius, a hill situate half way between
Tempe and Larissa.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f62" name="f62"></a>62</span>
The Romans, without quitting the bank of the Peneus,
removed their camp to a place of greater safety. Thither
came Misagenes, the Numidian, with one thousand horse, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2021" id="Page_2021">Pg 2021</a></span>
a like number of foot, besides twenty-two elephants. The
king soon after held a council on the general plan to be pursued;
and as the presumption inspired by the late success
had by this time subsided, some of his friends ventured to
advise him to employ his good fortune as the means of
obtaining an honourable peace, rather than to let himself be
so far transported with vain hopes, as to expose himself to
the hazard of an irretrievable misfortune. They observed,
that &#8220;to use moderation in prosperity, and not to confide too
much in the calm of present circumstances, was the part of a
man of prudence, who deserved success; and they recommended
it to him to send to the consul, to renew the treaty,
on the same terms which his father had received from Titus
Quintius, his conqueror; for the war could never be terminated
in a more glorious manner than by such a memorable
battle, nor could a surer hope of a lasting peace ever occur,
than that afforded by existing circumstances, as they were
likely to make the Romans, dispirited by their defeat, more
willing to come to terms. But should they, with their native
obstinacy, spurn reasonable conditions, then gods and men
would bear witness both to the moderation of Perseus, and to
the stubborn pride of the others.&#8221; The king&#8217;s inclination was
never averse to such measures; therefore this opinion received
the approbation of the majority. The ambassadors
sent to the consul had audience in a full council, summoned
for the purpose. They requested that &#8220;a peace might be
concluded; promising that Perseus should pay the Romans
the same tribute which Philip had engaged to pay, and
should evacuate the same cities, lands, and places, which
Philip had evacuated.&#8221; Such were the proposals of the
ambassadors. When they withdrew, and the council deliberated
concerning them, the Roman firmness prevailed in their
determination. So completely was it the practice of that
time, to assume in adversity the countenance of prosperity,
and in prosperity to moderate the temper. They resolved to
give this answer: &#8220;That peace should be granted on this
condition only; that the king should give to the senate an
entirely unconditional right, of deciding concerning him and
all Macedon.&#8221; When the ambassadors brought back this
answer, such as were unacquainted with their usual mode of
acting, were astonished at the obstinate perseverance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2022" id="Page_2022">Pg 2022</a></span>
Romans, and most people advised the king to make no further
mention of peace, for &#8220;the enemy would soon come to solicit
that which they now disdained when offered.&#8221; Perseus feared
this haughtiness, since it proceeded from a confidence in their
strength, and increasing the sum of money, with the hope of
purchasing peace by treasure, did not cease to solicit the mind
of the consul. After the consul made no change in the
answer which he had first given, Perseus, having despaired
of peace, returned to Sycurium, from which he had set out
with the intention of trying again the fortune of war.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f63" name="f63"></a>63</span>
The news of this cavalry action spread through
Greece, produced a discovery of the wishes of the people.
For not only those who professed an attachment to the
Macedonians, but the generality, who were bound to the
Romans under the weightiest obligations, and some who had
even felt the power and haughty behaviour of the Macedonians,
received the account with joy; and that for no other
cause, than out of an evil passion which the mob displays,
even in contests of sports, of favouring the worse and weaker
party. Meanwhile, in B&#339;otia, the pr&aelig;tor, Lucretius, pushed
the siege of Haliartus with all imaginable vigour. And
although the besieged had no foreign aid, except some
young Coron&aelig;ans, who had come into the town at the
beginning of the siege, and were without hope of relief, yet
they maintained the defence with courage beyond their
strength. For they made frequent irruptions against the
works; and when the ram was applied, they crushed it to the
ground, by dropping on it a mass of lead; and whenever
those who worked the engine avoided the blow by changing
its position, the besieged by working in masses, and collecting
stones out of the rubbish, quickly erected a new wall in the
room of that which had been demolished. The pr&aelig;tor, when
the progress by machines was too slow, ordered scaling-ladders
to be distributed among the companies, resolving to
make a general assault on the walls. He thought the number
of his men sufficient for this, and the more so because on one
side of the city, which is bounded by a morass, it would
neither be useful nor practicable to form an attack. Lucretius
himself led two thousand chosen men to a place where two
towers, and the wall between them, had been thrown down;
hoping that, while he endeavoured to climb over the ruins,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2023" id="Page_2023">Pg 2023</a></span>
and the townsmen crowded thither to oppose him, the walls,
being left defenceless, in some part or other might be taken by
escalade. The besieged were not remiss in preparing to repel
his assault; for, on the ground, overspread with the rubbish,
they placed faggots of dry bushes, and standing with burning
torches in their hands, they often threatened to set them on fire,
in order that, being covered from the enemy by the smoke and
flames, they might have time to throw up a wall in the inside.
But a casualty prevented this plan from succeeding; for there
fell suddenly such a quantity of rain, as hindered the faggots
from being kindled; thus a passage was laid open by drawing
the smoking faggots aside; and while all were attending to the
defence of one particular spot, the walls were mounted by
escalade in many places at once. In the first tumult of storming
the town the old men and children, whom chance threw
in the way, were put to the sword indiscriminately, while the
men who carried arms fled into the citadel. Next day, these,
having no remaining hope, surrendered, and were sold by
public auction. Their number was about two thousand five
hundred. The ornaments of the city, consisting of statues and
pictures, with all the valuable booty, were carried off to the
ships, and the city was razed to the ground. The pr&aelig;tor then
led his army into Thebes, which fell into his hands without a
dispute; when he gave the city in possession to the exiles, and
the party that sided with the Romans; and sold, as slaves,
the families of those who were of the opposite faction, and
favoured the king and the Macedonians. After performing
these acts in B&#339;otia, he returned to the sea-coast to his fleet.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f64" name="f64"></a>64</span>
Whilst these events were taking place in B&#339;otia, Perseus
lay a considerable time encamped at Sycurium. Having
learned there that the Romans were busily employed in collecting
corn from all the adjacent grounds, and that when it
was brought in, they cut off the ears with sickles, each before
his own tent, in order that he might thresh it the cleaner, and
had by this means formed large heaps of straw in all quarters
of the camp: he, supposing that he might set it on fire, ordered
torches, faggots, and bundles of tow, dipped in pitch, to be got
ready; and thus prepared, he began his march at midnight,
that he might make the attack at the first dawn, and without
discovery. But his stratagem was frustrated: the advanced
guards, who were surprised, alarmed the rest of the troops by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2024" id="Page_2024">Pg 2024</a></span>
the tumult and terror among them: orders were given to
take arms with all speed, and the soldiers were instantly
drawn up on the rampart and at the gates in readiness to defend
the camp. Perseus immediately ordered his army to face
about; the baggage to go foremost, and the battalions of foot
to follow, while himself, with the cavalry and light infantry,
kept behind, in order to cover the rear; for he expected, what
indeed happened, that the enemy would pursue and harass his
rear. There was a short scuffle between the light infantry,
mostly in skirmishing parties. The infantry and cavalry returned
to their camp, without any disturbance. After reaping
all the corn in that quarter, the Romans removed into the
territory of Cranno, which was yet untouched. While they
were encamped there, deeming themselves secure on account
of the distance between the camps, and the difficulty of the
march, through a country as destitute of water as was that
between Sycurium and Cranno, the king&#8217;s cavalry and light
infantry appeared suddenly, at the dawn of day, on the nearest
hills, and caused a violent alarm. They had marched from
Sycurium at noon the preceding day, and had left their infantry
at the dawn in the next plain. Perseus stood a short
time on the hills, in expectation that the Romans might be induced
to come to a cavalry action; but after they did not
move, he sent a horseman to order the infantry to return to
Sycurium, and he himself soon followed. The Roman horse
pursued at a small distance, in expectation of being able to attack
such as might disperse and separate; but seeing them
retreat in close order, and attentive to their standards and
ranks, they desisted, and returned to their camp.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f65" name="f65"></a>65</span>
The king, disliking the length of the march, removed
his camp from Sycurium to Mopsilum; and the Romans,
having cut down all the corn about Cranno, marched into the
lands of Phalanna. When Perseus learnt from a deserter that
they carried on their reaping there, without any armed guard,
straggling at random through the fields, he set out with one
thousand horsemen and two thousand Thracians and Cretans,
and after marching with all the speed that he possibly could,
unexpectedly fell on the Romans. Nearly a thousand carts,
with horses harnessed to them, most of them loaded, were
seized, and about six hundred men were taken. The charge
of guarding this booty, and conducting it to the camp, he gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2025" id="Page_2025">Pg 2025</a></span>
to a party of three hundred Cretans, and calling in the rest of
his infantry and the cavalry who were spread about, killing
the enemy, he led them against the nearest station, thinking
that it might be overpowered without much difficulty.
Lucius Pompeius, a military tribune, was in command; who
led his men, who were dismayed by the sudden approach of the
enemy, to a hill at a little distance, hoping to defend himself
by means of the advantage of the ground, as he was inferior
in number and strength. There he collected his men in a
circular body, that, by closing their shields, they might guard
themselves from arrows and javelins; on which Perseus, surrounding
the hill with armed men, ordered a party to strive
to climb it on all sides, and come to close fighting, and the
rest to throw missile weapons against them from a distance.
The Romans were environed with dangers, in whatever manner
they acted; for they could not fight in a body, on account
of the enemy who endeavoured to mount the hill; and, if
they broke their ranks in order to skirmish with these, they
were exposed to the arrows and javelins. They were galled
most severely by the Cestrospendana. A dart, two palms in
length, was fixed to a shaft, half a cubit long, and of the thickness
of a man&#8217;s finger; round this, which was made of pine, three
feathers were tied, as is commonly done with arrows. To throw
this they used a sling, which had two beds, unequal in size and
in the length of the strings. When the weapon was balanced
in these, and the slinger whirled it round by the longer string
and discharged it, it flew with the rapid force of a leaden
bullet. When one half of the soldiers had been wounded by
these and other weapons of all kinds, and the rest were so
fatigued that they could hardly bear the weight of their arms,
the king pressed them to surrender, assured them of safety,
and sometimes promised them rewards; but not one could be
prevailed on to yield; and hope now dawned on them determined
to die. For when some of the foragers, fleeing back
to the camp, had announced to the consul that the party was
surrounded; alarmed for the safety of such a number of his
countrymen, (for they were near eight hundred, and all
Romans,) he set out with the cavalry and light infantry,
joined by the newly arrived Numidian auxiliaries, horse, foot,
and elephants, and ordered the military tribunes, that the battalions
of the legions should follow. He himself, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2026" id="Page_2026">Pg 2026</a></span>
strengthened the light-armed auxiliaries with his own light
infantry, hastened forward at their head to the hill. He was
accompanied by Eumenes, Attalus, and the Numidian prince,
Misagenes.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f66" name="f66"></a>66</span>
When the standards of the Romans first came in sight
of the surrounded troops, their spirits were raised from the
depth of despair. Perseus&#8217;s best plan would have been to have
contented himself with his accidental good fortune, in having
killed and taken so many of the foragers, and not to have
wasted time in attacking this detachment of the enemy; or,
after he had engaged in the attempt, as he was sensible that
he had not a proper force with him, to have gone off, while
he might, with safety; instead of which, intoxicated with
success, he waited for the arrival of the enemy, and sent messengers
in haste to bring up the phalanx, which would have
been too late for the emergency. The men must have engaged
in all the disorder of a hurried march, against troops
duly formed and prepared. The consul, arriving first, proceeded
instantly to action. The Macedonians, for some time
made resistance; afterwards, when they were equal to their
enemies in no respect, having lost three hundred foot, and
twenty-four of the best of their horse, of what they call the
Sacred Cohort, (among whom fell Antimachus, who commanded
that body,) they endeavoured to retreat: but this
march back was more disorderly and confused than the battle
itself. When the phalanx, being summoned by a hasty order,
was marching at full speed, it met first, in a narrow pass, the
carts laden with corn, with the mass of prisoners. These they
put to the sword, and both parties suffered great annoyance;
but none waited till the troops might pass in some sort of
order, but the soldiers tumbled the loads down a precipice,
which was the only possible way to clear the road, and the
horses, when they were goaded, pushed furiously through the
crowd. Scarcely had they disentangled themselves from the
disorderly throng of the prisoners, when they met the king&#8217;s
party and the discomfited horsemen. And now the shouts of
the men, calling to their comrades to go back, raised a consternation
not unlike a total rout; insomuch, that if the
enemy had ventured to enter the defile, and carry the pursuit
a little farther, they might have done them very great damage.
But the consul, when he had relieved his party from the hill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2027" id="Page_2027">Pg 2027</a></span>
content with that moderate share of success, led back his
troops to the camp. There are writers who state that a
general engagement took place that day, in which eight
thousand of the enemy were killed, among whom were Sopater
and Antipater, two of the king&#8217;s generals, and about two
thousand eight hundred taken, with twenty-seven military
standards; and that it was not a bloodless victory, for that
above four thousand three hundred fell, and five standards of
the left wing of the allies were lost.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="f67" name="f67"></a>67</span>
This day revived the spirits of the Romans, and struck
Perseus with dismay: to such a degree that, after staying at
Mopsilum a few days, chiefly out of anxiety to bury his dead, he
left a very strong garrison at Gonnus, and led back his army
into Macedon. He left Timotheus, one of his generals, with
a small party at Phila, ordering him to endeavour to gain the
affection of the Magnesians, by his proximity to them. On
his arrival at Pella, he sent his troops to their winter quarters,
and proceeded with Cotys to Thessalonica. There an account
was received that Atlesbis, a petty prince of Thrace, and
Corragus, an officer belonging to Eumenes, had made an
inroad into the dominions of Cotys, and seized on the district
called Marene. Supposing, therefore, that he must send
Cotys home to defend his own territories, he honoured him at
his departure with very magnificent presents, and paid to his
cavalry two hundred talents,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> which was but half a year&#8217;s pay,
though he had agreed to give them the pay of a whole year.
The consul, hearing that Perseus had left the country, marched
his army to Gonnus, in hopes of being able to take that town:
which standing directly opposite to the pass of Tempe, at
its entrance, serves as the safest barrier to Macedon, and
renders a descent into Thessaly easy. But the city, from the
nature of its situation and the strength of the garrison, was
impregnable; he therefore gave up the design, and turning
his route to Perrh&aelig;bia, having taken Mall&aelig;a at the first
assault, he demolished it; and after reducing Tripolis, and
the rest of Perrh&aelig;bia, returned to Larissa. From that place
he sent home Eumenes and Attalus, and quartered Misagenes
and his Numidians, for the winter, in the nearest towns of
Thessaly. One half of his army he distributed through
Thessaly, in such a manner that all had commodious winter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2028" id="Page_2028">Pg 2028</a></span>quarters, and served at the same time as a defence to the
cities. He sent Quintus Mucius, lieutenant-general, with
two thousand men, to secure Ambracia, and dismissed all the
allied troops belonging to the Grecian states, except the
Ach&aelig;ans. With the other half of his army he marched
into the Ach&aelig;an Phthiotis; where, finding Pteleum deserted
by the inhabitants, he levelled it to the ground. He received
the voluntary surrender of Antron, and he then marched
against Larissa: this city was likewise deserted, the whole
multitude taking refuge in the citadel, to which he laid siege.
First the Macedonians, who constituted the king&#8217;s garrison,
withdrew through fear; and then the townsmen, on being
abandoned by them, surrendered immediately. He then
hesitated whether he should first attack Demetrias, or take a
view of affairs in B&#339;otia. The Thebans, being harassed by
the Coron&aelig;ans, pressed him to go into B&#339;otia; wherefore, in
compliance with their entreaties, and because that country
was better adapted for winter quarters than Magnesia, he led
his army thither.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Several pr&aelig;tors were condemned because they had conducted themselves
with avarice and cruelty in the administration of their provinces. Publius
Licinius Crassus, the proconsul, took by storm several cities in
Greece, and plundered them with great cruelty. For this reason the
captives, who were sold by him, were subsequently, by a decree of the
senate, restored to their respective states. Many tyrannical acts were
done to the allies by the admirals of the Roman fleets also. This book
contains likewise the successful operations of king Perseus in Thrace,
with the conquest of Dardania and Illyricum; Gentius was the king of
the latter country. The commotions which arose in Spain through the
agency of Olonicus, were quelled by his death. Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus
was chosen by the censors prince of the senate.</i></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g1" name="g1"></a>1</span>
In the same summer in which the Romans were conquerors
in the cavalry action in Thessaly, the lieutenant-general,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2029" id="Page_2029">Pg 2029</a></span>
sent by the consul to Illyricum, compelled, by force
of arms, two opulent cities to surrender, and gave the inhabitants
all their effects, in hopes, by the reputation of his clemency,
to allure to submission the inhabitants of Carnus, a
city strongly fortified. But after he could neither induce
them to surrender, nor take their city by a siege; that his
soldiers might not be fatigued by the two sieges without
reaping any advantage, he sacked those cities which he had
spared before. The other consul, Caius Cassius, performed
nothing memorable in Gaul, the province that fell to his lot;
but made an ill-judged attempt to lead his army through
Illyricum to Macedon. The senate learned his having undertaken
that march from deputies from Aquileia, who complained
that their colony, which was new, weak, and but
indifferently fortified, lay in the midst of hostile states,
Istrians and Illyrians; and begged the senate to take into
consideration some method of strengthening it. These, being
asked whether they wished that matter to be given in charge
to the consul Caius Cassius, replied, that Cassius, after
assembling his forces at Aquileia, had set out on a march
through Illyricum into Macedon. The fact was at first
deemed incredible, and each individual was under the impression
that he had gone on an expedition against the Carnians,
or perhaps the Istrians. The Aquileians then said, that all
that they knew, or could take upon them to affirm, was that
corn for thirty days had been given to the soldiers, and that
guides, who knew the roads from Italy to Macedon, had been
sought for and carried with him. The senate were highly
displeased that the consul should presume to act so improperly
as to leave his own province, and remove into that of another;
and lead his army by a new and dangerous route through
foreign states, and thereby open for so many nations a passage
into Italy. Assembled in great numbers, they decreed that
the pr&aelig;tor, Caius Sulpicius, should nominate out of the senate
three deputies, who should set out from the city on that very
day, make all possible haste to overtake the consul, Cassius,
wherever he might be, and tell him not to engage in a war
with any nation, unless that against which the senate voted
that such war should be waged. These deputies left the city;
Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Marcus Fulvius, and Publius
Marcius Rex. The fears entertained for the consul and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2030" id="Page_2030">Pg 2030</a></span>
army caused the business of fortifying Aquileia to be postponed
for that time.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g2" name="g2"></a>2</span>
Then were introduced to the senate ambassadors from
the several states of both the Spains; these, after complaining
of the avarice and pride of the Roman magistrates, fell on
their knees, and implored the senate not to suffer them, who
were their allies, to be more cruelly plundered and ill-treated
than their enemies. When they complained of other unworthy
treatment, and it was also evident that money had been
extorted from them; a charge was then given to Lucius
Canuleius, the pr&aelig;tor, to whom Spain was allotted, to appoint
out of the senatorian order five judges delegate, to try each
person from whom the Spaniards might demand back their
money; and that they should give the latter power to choose
whomsoever they pleased as patrons. The ambassadors being
called into the senate-house, the decree of the senate was read
aloud, and they were ordered to name their protectors. They
named four,&mdash;Marcus Porcius Cato, Publius Cornelius Scipio,
son of Cneius, Lucius &AElig;milius Paullus, son of Lucius, and
Caius Sulpicius Gallus. The judges entered on the business
with the case of Marcus Titinius first, who had been pr&aelig;tor
in Hither Spain, in the consulate of Aulus Manlius and Marcus
Junius. The cause was twice adjourned, and on the third
hearing the accused was acquitted. A dispute took place
between the ambassadors of the two provinces; and the states
of Hither Spain chose for their patrons Marcus Cato and
Scipio; those of Farther Spain, Lucius Paullus and Sulpicius
Gallus. Publius Furius Philus and Marcus Matienus were
brought before the judges, the former by the states of the
Hither province, and the latter by those of the Farther; the
former of whom had been pr&aelig;tor, three years before, in the consulate
of Spurius Postumius and Quintus Mucius; and the latter,
two years before, when Lucius Postumius and Marcus Popilius
were consuls. Both, being accused of most heinous crimes, were
remanded; but when the cause was about to be pleaded anew,
it was represented on their behalf that they had quitted the
country as voluntary exiles. Furius had gone to Pr&aelig;neste,
Matienus to Tibur, to live in exile. There was a report that
the plaintiffs were not suffered, by their patrons, to bring
charges against people of high birth and power; and Canuleius
the pr&aelig;tor increased this suspicion, for having neglected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2031" id="Page_2031">Pg 2031</a></span>
that business, he applied himself to the enlisting of soldiers.
Then he suddenly went off to his province, lest more might
be accused by the Spaniards. Although past transactions
were thus consigned to silence, yet the senate deliberated for
the interest of the Spaniards in future, for they passed an
order that the Roman magistrates should not have the valuation
of the corn; nor should they compel the Spaniards to
compound for their twentieths at such prices as they pleased;
and that officers should not be placed in command of their
towns for the purpose of exacting money.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g3" name="g3"></a>3</span>
There came also from Spain another embassy, from a
new race of men. They, representing that they were the offspring
of Roman soldiers and Spanish women, to whom the
Romans had not been united in wedlock, and that their number
amounted to more than four thousand, petitioned for a grant of
some town to be given them in which they might reside. The
senate decreed, that &#8220;they should put their names on a list
before Lucius Canuleius; and that, if he should judge any
of them deserving of freedom, it was their pleasure that they
should be settled as a colony at Carteia, on the ocean. That
such of the present inhabitants of Carteia as wished to remain
there, should have the privilege of being considered as
colonists, and should have lands assigned them. That this
should be deemed a Latin settlement, and be called a colony
of freed-men.&#8221; At this time Prince Gulussa, son of king Masinissa,
arrived from Africa as ambassador from his father. Carthaginian
ambassadors also came. Gulussa, being first introduced
to the senate, gave a detail of the succours sent by his
father to the maintenance of the war in Macedon, and promised,
that if they wished to order any thing besides, he
would execute it in return for the meritorious deeds of the
Roman people; and he warned the conscript fathers to be
on their guard against the treachery of the Carthaginians.
That they &#8220;had formed the design of fitting out a powerful
fleet, in favour, as they pretended, of the Romans, and
against the Macedonians; but when it should be equipped
and ready for action, they would have it in their power to
make their own option which party they would treat as a
friend, and which as a foe.&#8221; <i>Then he pleaded Masinissa&#8217;s
cause concerning the land and towns, which, according to the
complaint of the Carthaginians, were wrested from them, by</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2032" id="Page_2032">Pg 2032</a></span>
<i>him; and the question was debated with great warmth between
the prince and the Carthaginian ambassadors. We have not
ascertained what were the arguments brought forward by both
parties, or what was the reply given by the senate. However
this contest ceased, and seemed to slumber for several years;
it was subsequently renewed, and burst forth into the flames of
that war which was undertaken by the Carthaginians against
Masinissa, necessarily waged against Rome, and terminated
only by the downfal of Carthage. We find, in the annals of
this year, that a son was born of a virgin, while she was under
the strict guardianship of her parents, and by the order of the
soothsayers was conveyed to a desert island. The elections
were held by Caius Cassius the consul, in which Aulus Hostilius
Mancinus and Aulus Atilius Serranus were appointed
consuls. Then Marcus R&aelig;cius, Quintus M&aelig;nius, Lucius
Flatensius, Quintus &AElig;lius P&aelig;tus, Titus Manlius Torquatus,
and Caius Hostilius, were elected pr&aelig;tors. Italy and Macedon
are declared the consular provinces. Italy fell to Atilius,
and Macedon to Hostilius. With regard to the pr&aelig;tors, R&aelig;ius
obtained by lot the city jurisdiction, M&aelig;nias the foreign. The
fleet, together with the sea-coast of Greece, fell to Hortensius.
The rest of the pr&aelig;torian provinces were, without doubt, those
of the former year, viz. Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia. But
what pr&aelig;tors obtained the command in each cannot be ascertained,
in consequence of the silence of the ancient records.
In the mean time Publius Licinius, as if he were sent to wage
war not against Perseus, but the Greeks, turned the rage of
war, so ineffectual against the real enemy, towards wretches
who were unable to cope with him, and took by storm and
plundered in a most merciless manner several cities in B&#339;otia,
in which he was passing the winter. When the Coroneans, who
were the most ill-used, threw themselves on the protection of
the senate, that august body decreed that the captives who had
been sold should be restored to freedom. Lucretius the pr&aelig;tor,
who had the command of the fleet, imitated, or rather surpassed,
the cruelty and avarice of the consul; he was oppressive
to the allies, despicable in the sight of the enemy. Since
Perseus, by a sudden attack on the fleet stationed at Oreum,
took twenty transports laden with corn, sunk the rest of them,
and even made himself master of four galleys of five banks of
oars. Matters were successfully managed by Perseus in Thrace</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2033" id="Page_2033">Pg 2033</a></span>
<i>also where he made a diversion in that country in favour of
Cotys against the forces of Atlesbis and Corragus. Nor truly
was Cotys false to his own interests, as he was a man indefatigable
in war, and pre-eminent in council, a Thracian by
birth alone, not by his habits; for he was singularly sober and
temperate, and, besides, quite amiable, owing to his mercy and
moderation. The tide of war flowed on in favour of Perseus,
for at this time the nation of the Epirotes also passed over to
his party, by the advice of Cephalus, who however was induced
to revolt more by necessity, than his own free will. He was
a man of remarkable prudence and firmness, and even then
influenced by the best of feelings. For he had prayed to the
immortal gods that war might never break out between the
Romans and Perseus, and that they might never come to a
decisive struggle. For he had determined, when the war broke
out, to aid the Romans according to the written articles of the
treaty, but to do nothing further than the conditions of that
treaty demanded, and not to be complaisant in a servile or
disgraceful manner. These plans were confounded by one
Charopus, the grandson of that Charopus who opened the pass
at the river Arus to Titus Quinctius, in the war against Philip;
this Charopus was a worthless flatterer of those in power,
and a strange adept at forging calumnies against men of the
best character. He was educated at Rome, having been sent
there by his grandfather, in order that he might learn thoroughly
the Roman language and literature. Owing to this
he became acquainted with, and dear to, very many of the
Romans; and yet, after his return home, as he was naturally
of a fickle and depraved disposition, and besides inspired with
confidence, owing to his intimacy with the Roman nobles, he
was constantly sneering at the leading men of the state. At
first he was despised by all, nor was any regard paid to his
allegations. But after the war with Perseus broke out, and
suspicions were rife throughout Greece, as many openly professed
their zeal for Perseus, and still more felt it in secret,
Charopus never ceased accusing before the Romans those who
were invested with authority among the Epirotes. The intimate
connexion that Cephalus, and the others who adopted that line
of politics, had formerly with the kings of Macedon, gave a
specious appearance and false colouring to his calumnies.
Already, in truth, by malignantly prying into all their acts</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2034" id="Page_2034">Pg 2034</a></span>
<i>and words, and putting the worst construction on them, and
by falsifying the truth by adding and subtracting whatever he
chose, he was succeeding in having his accusations believed.
Nor however were Cephalus, and, those who had been the associates
of his designs in the management of the republic, moved
by these allegations, since they relied on the full consciousness
of unsullied fidelity towards the Romans. But when they
perceived that the Romans lent an ear to these calumnies, and
that some of the &AElig;tolian nobles, whom the calumnies of slanderers
had rendered objects of suspicion as well as themselves,
were taken away to Rome, then at length they believed it necessary
to provide for the safety of themselves and their property.
And they, when no other resource than the king&#8217;s friendship
suggested itself to them, were compelled to form an alliance
with Perseus, and give their nation into his hands. Aulus
Hostilius and Aulus Atilius, the consuls, having entered on
their office at Rome, and having performed such religious and
political acts as are usually executed by the consuls in and
around the city, set out for their provinces. Hostilius, to whose
lot Macedon had fallen, when he was hastening into Thessaly,
to join the army there, entered Epirus, which had not yet
openly revolted, and was very near falling into the hands of
Perseus. For one Theodotus and Philostratus, under the impression
that, if they would deliver him up to the king, they
would receive great favour from Perseus; and, besides, would
strike a very severe blow against the Romans at the time, sent
letters to the king, desiring him to come up with all the speed
he could. And were it not that Perseus was retained by delay,
thrown in his way by the Molossians, at the passage of the
river Lous, and that the consul, being informed of his danger,
had changed his intended route, there was not a possibility of
his escaping. Therefore, having left Epirus, he sailed to
Anticyra, and from the latter place proceeded to Thessaly.
Having received the command of the army there, he marched
at once against the enemy. But he was not a whit more successful
in the operations of the war than his predecessor.
For having engaged in battle with the king, he was beaten,
and when at first he attempted to force his way through
Elimea, and afterwards to march secretly through Thessaly,
he was compelled to desist from his useless attempts, as Perseus
anticipated all his man&#339;uvres. Nor did Hortensius the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2035" id="Page_2035">Pg 2035</a></span>
<i>pr&aelig;tor, to whom the fleet had fallen, carry on any of his
operations with sufficient skill or success, for none of his acts
deserves better to be remembered than his cruel and perfidious
plundering of the city of the Abdertes, when they endeavoured
to avert, by entreaty, the intolerable burdens imposed on them.
Perseus, therefore, now despising the Romans, as if he were
completely at leisure and disengaged, made an incursion, for
the purpose of gaining a fresh wreath of laurel, against the
Dardanians, and having slain ten thousand of the barbarians,
bore away great booty.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g4" name="g4"></a>4</span>
<i>In this year the Celtiberians made some warlike motions
in Spain, at the instigation of a strange leader named Olonicus,
some give him the name of Salindicus. He was a man of great
cunning and boldness, and brandishing a silver spear, which
he pretended was sent to him from heaven, with the agitation
of a person inspired, he attracted universal attention. But when
he, with corresponding rashness, had approached the camp of the
Roman pr&aelig;tor, in the dusk of the evening, with the intention
of slaying him, bringing with him an associate in his mad enterprise,
he was killed, near the very tent, by a sentinel with a
javelin: his companion paid the same penalty for his foolish
undertaking. The pr&aelig;tor immediately ordered both their
heads to be cut off and fixed on spears, and then given to some
of the prisoners to bear to their countrymen.</i> These entering
the camp and showing the heads caused such panic, that if the
Romans had instantly advanced to the camp they might have
taken it. As it was, a general flight took place; and some
were of opinion that ambassadors should be sent to supplicate
for peace; while a great number of states, on hearing this intelligence,
surrendered: and when the pr&aelig;tor had given pardon
to them while endeavouring to excuse themselves, and laying
all the blame on the madness of the two individuals who had
voluntarily offered themselves for punishment, he proceeded
immediately to the other states, every one of which acknowledged
his authority, and he passed with his army in peace,
without doing any injury, through the tract of country where
before the flames of war raged with the utmost fury. This
mercy shown by the pr&aelig;tor, by which he overcame without
bloodshed a very savage people, was the more pleasing to the
senate and people, as the war had been conducted in Greece
both by the consul Licinius and the pr&aelig;tor Lucretius with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2036" id="Page_2036">Pg 2036</a></span>
uncommon avarice and cruelty. The plebeian tribunes, daily
in their speeches to the people, censured Lucretius for being
absent, though it was alleged in his favour that he was
abroad on the business of the public. But so little was then
known of what passed, even in the vicinity of Rome, that he
was, at that very time, at his own estate near Antium; and
with money amassed in his expedition, was bringing water
thither from the river Loracina; he is said to have contracted
for the execution of this work at the expense of one hundred
and thirty thousand <i>asses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> He also decorated the temple of
&AElig;sculapius with pictures taken from among the spoils. But
ambassadors from Abdera diverted the public displeasure, and
the consequent disgrace, from Lucretius to his successor.
These stood weeping at the door of the senate-house, and
complained, that &#8220;their town had been stormed and plundered
by Hortensius. His only reason,&#8221; they said, &#8220;for destroying
their city was, that, on his demanding from them one hundred
thousand denariuses,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and fifty thousand measures of wheat,
they had requested time until they could send ambassadors on
the subject, both to the consul Hostilius, and to Rome; and
that they had scarcely reached the consul, when they heard
that the town was stormed, their nobles beheaded, and the rest
sold for slaves.&#8221; This act appeared to the senate deserving
their indignation, and they passed the same decree respecting
the people of Abdera as they had passed concerning the
Coron&aelig;ans. They also ordered Quintus M&aelig;nius, the pr&aelig;tor,
to publish the notice in a general assembly, as had been
done the year before. Two ambassadors, Caius Sempronius
Bl&aelig;sus and Sextus Julius C&aelig;sar, were sent to restore the
Abderites to liberty; and were likewise commissioned to deliver
a message from the senate to the consul Hostilius, and to
the pr&aelig;tor Hortensius, that the senate judged the war made
on the Abderites to be unjust, and had directed that all those
who were in servitude should be sought out and restored to
liberty.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g5" name="g5"></a>5</span>
At the same time, complaints were laid before the
senate against Caius Cassius, who had been consul the year
before, and was then a military tribune in Macedon, under
Aulus Hostilius, and ambassadors came from Cincibilus, a king
of the Gauls. His brother made a speech to the senate, complaining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2037" id="Page_2037">Pg 2037</a></span>
that Caius Cassius had entirely wasted the country
of the Alpine Gauls, their allies, and carried off into slavery
many thousands of their people. Ambassadors came at the
same time from the Carnians, Istrians, and Iapidans, who
represented, that &#8220;at first guides had been demanded from
them by the consul, Cassius, to point out the road to him,
leading his army into Macedon: that he had parted from
them in a peaceable manner, as if to carry war elsewhere; but
afterwards, when he had proceeded half way, he returned,
and overran their country in a hostile manner, spreading depredations
and fires through every quarter; nor had they as
yet been able to discover for what reason they were treated as
enemies by the consul.&#8221; The following answer was returned
to the absent prince of the Gauls, and the states present, that
&#8220;the senate had no previous knowledge of those acts of which
they complained; nor did they approve of them if they did
take place. But that it would still be unjust to condemn,
unheard and absent, a man of consular rank, especially as he
was employed abroad in the business of the public. That,
when Caius Cassius should come home from Macedonia, if
they chose then to prosecute their complaints against him, in
his presence, the senate, after examining the matter, would
endeavour to give them satisfaction.&#8221; It was further resolved,
that not only a verbal answer should be given, but that ambassadors
should be also sent to those nations, (two to the transalpine
chieftain, and three to the other states,) to notify to
them the determinations of the senate. They voted, that
presents, to the amount of two thousand <i>asses</i>,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> should be sent
to the ambassadors; and to the prince, and his brother, some
of extraordinary value: two chains made of gold, and weighing
five pounds; five silver vases, amounting to twenty
pounds&#8217; weight; two horses, fully caparisoned, with grooms to
attend them, and horsemen&#8217;s armour and cloaks, besides suits
of apparel to their attendants, both freemen and slaves.
These were presented to them; and, on their request, permission
was given to each of them to purchase ten horses, and
convey them out of Italy. Caius L&aelig;lius and Marcus &AElig;milius
were sent ambassadors with the Gauls, to the regions on the
northern side of the Alps; and Caius Cicinius, Publius Cornelius
Blasio, and Titus Memmius, to the other states.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2038" id="Page_2038">Pg 2038</a></span></p>
<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g6" name="g6"></a>6</span>
Embassies from many states of Greece and Asia arrived
at Rome at the same time. The first that had audience of
the senate were the Athenians, who represented, that &#8220;they
had sent what ships and soldiers they had to the consul Publius
Licinius, and the pr&aelig;tor Caius Lucretius, who did not
think proper to employ their forces, but ordered the state to
furnish one hundred thousand measures of corn; and, notwithstanding
that they were the cultivators of a sterile soil, and
that they fed even the husbandmen with imported grain, yet
that they might not appear deficient in their duty, they had
made up that quantity, and were ready to perform any other
service that might be required of them.&#8221; The Milesians
making no mention of their past services, promised to readily
afford any assistance in the war which the senate should think
proper to demand. The Alabandians said, that they had
erected a temple to the city of Rome, and instituted anniversary
games to her divinity; that they had brought a
golden crown, of fifty pounds&#8217; weight, to be deposited in the
Capitol, as an offering to Jupiter supremely good and great;
also three hundred horsemen&#8217;s bucklers, which they were
ready to deliver to any person appointed to receive them;
and they requested permission to lodge the said offering as
intended, and to perform sacrifice. Ambassadors from Lampsacus,
who brought a crown of eighty pounds&#8217; weight, made
the same request, and represented to the senate that &#8220;they had
renounced the party of Perseus as soon as the Roman army
arrived in Macedon, though they had been under the dominion
of that monarch, and formerly of Philip. In return for
which, and for their having contributed every assistance in
their power to the Roman commanders, they only requested
to be admitted into the friendship of the Roman people; and
that, if peace should be made with Perseus, they should be exempted
from falling again into his power.&#8221; A gracious answer
was given to the rest of the ambassadors, and the pr&aelig;tor,
Quintus M&aelig;nius, was ordered to enrol the people of Lampsacus
as allies. Presents were made to all, and two thousand
asses were given to each. The Alabandians were desired to
carry back the bucklers into Macedon, to the consul Aulus
Hostilius. At the same time ambassadors came from Africa;
those of the Carthaginians acquainted the senate that they had
brought down to the sea-coast a million of measures of wheat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2039" id="Page_2039">Pg 2039</a></span>
and five hundred thousand of barley, &#8220;to be transported to
whatever place the senate should order. They were sensible,&#8221;
they said, &#8220;that this offer, and act of duty, were very inferior
the deserts of the Roman people, and to their own inclinations;
but that on many other occasions, when both
nations were in favourable circumstances, they had performed
the duties of faithful and grateful allies.&#8221; In like manner,
ambassadors from Masinissa offered the same quantity of
wheat, one thousand two hundred horsemen, and twelve
elephants; desiring, that if he could be of service in any
other particular, the senate would lay their commands on him,
and he would execute them with as much zeal as if he had
proposed them himself. Thanks were returned both to the
Carthaginians and to the king; and they were requested to
send the supplies, which they had promised, into Macedon, to
the consul Hostilius. A present of two thousand <i>asses</i> was
made to each of the ambassadors.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g7" name="g7"></a>7</span>
When the ambassadors of the Cretans mentioned that
they had sent into Macedon the number of archers which
had been demanded by the consul, Publius Licinius, on being
interrogated, they did not deny that a greater number of their
archers were serving in the army of Perseus than in that of
the Romans: on which they received this answer; that &#8220;if
the Cretans were candidly and sincerely resolved to prefer
the friendship of the Roman people to that of king Perseus,
the Roman senate, on their part, would answer them as allies
who could be relied on. In the mean time, that they should
announce to their countrymen, that the senate required that
the Cretans should endeavour to call home, as soon as possible,
all the soldiers who were in the service of king Perseus.&#8221;
The Cretans being dismissed, the ambassadors from Chalcis
were called, whose embassy seemed to be a matter of extreme
necessity, from the very circumstance of their entering the
senate-house at all, since Miction, their chief, having lost the
use of his limbs, was introduced on a litter: and either the
plea of bad health had not appeared to himself an adequate
motive for seeking exemption from duty, though he was in
such a distressing state, or exemption had not been given him
at his request. After premising that no other part was alive
but his tongue, which served him to deplore the calamities of
his country, he represented, first, the friendly assistance given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2040" id="Page_2040">Pg 2040</a></span>
by his state to the Roman commanders and armies, both on
former occasions and in the war with Perseus; and then, the
instances of pride, avarice, and cruelty, which his countrymen
had suffered from the Roman pr&aelig;tor, Caius Lucretius, and
were at that very time suffering from Lucius Hortensius;
notwithstanding which, they were resolved to endure all
hardships, should they be even more grievous than they
underwent at present, rather than swerve from their allegiance.
&#8220;With regard to Lucretius and Hortensius, they knew
that it would have been safer to have shut their gates against
them, than to receive them into the city. For those cities which
had so done, remained in safety, as Emathea, Amphipolis
Maronea, and &AElig;nus; whereas, in Chalcis, the temples were
robbed of all their ornaments. Caius Lucretius had carried
off in ships, to Antium, the plunder amassed by such sacrilege
and had dragged persons of free condition into slavery; the
property of the allies of the Roman people was subjected to
rapine and plunder every day. For Hortensius, pursuing the
practice of Caius Lucretius, kept the crews of his ships in
lodgings both in summer and winter alike; so that their
houses were filled with a crowd of seamen, and those men who
showed no regard to propriety, either in their words or
actions, lived among the inhabitants, their wives, and children.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g8" name="g8"></a>8</span>
The senate resolved to call Lucretius before them, that
he might argue the matter in person, and exculpate himself.
But when he appeared, he heard many more crimes alleged
against him than had been mentioned in his absence; and
two more weighty and powerful accusers stood forth in support
of the charges, Manius Juventius Thalna and Cneius
Aufidius, plebeian tribunes. These not only arraigned him
bitterly in the senate, but dragged him out into the assembly
of the people, and there, after reproaching him with many
heinous crimes, they instituted a legal prosecution against him.
By order of the senate, the pr&aelig;tor, Quintus M&aelig;nius, gave this
answer to the ambassadors of Chalcis: that &#8220;the senate
acknowledged their account of the good offices done by them
to the Roman people, both on former occasions and during
the present war, to be true; and that their conduct met with
gratitude, as it ought: that as to the ill treatment, which
they complained of having received formerly from Caius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2041" id="Page_2041">Pg 2041</a></span>
Lucretius, and now from Lucius Hortensius, Roman pr&aelig;tors,
who could suppose that such things were done with the
approbation of the senate, who would consider that the
Roman people had made war on Perseus, and, before that, on
his father Philip, for the express purpose of asserting the
liberties of Greece, and not that their friends and allies should
receive such treatment from their magistrates: that they
would give them a letter to the pr&aelig;tor, Lucius Hortensius,
informing him that the proceedings, of which the people of
Chalcis complained, were highly displeasing to the senate;
charging him to take care that all free persons, who had been
reduced to slavery, should be sought out as soon as possible,
and restored to liberty; and commanding that no seamen,
except the masters of vessels, should be permitted to lodge on
shore.&#8221; Pursuant to the senate&#8217;s order, a letter to this purport
was written to Hortensius. A present of two thousand
<i>asses</i> was made to each of the ambassadors, and carriages
were hired for Miction, at the public expense, to carry him
commodiously to Brundusium. When the day of Caius
Lucretius&#8217;s trial came, the tribunes pleaded against him
before the people, and demanded that he should be fined in
the sum of one million of <i>asses</i>;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and an assembly of the
people being held, every one of the thirty-five pronounced
him guilty.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g9" name="g9"></a>9</span>
In Liguria, nothing worthy of record occurred in that
year; for the enemy made no hostile attempt, nor did the
consul march his legions into their country; on the contrary,
having made himself sure that there would be peace that year,
he discharged the soldiers of the two Roman legions within
sixty days after his arrival in the province, sent the troops of
the Latin confederates early into winter quarters at Luna and
Pis&aelig;, and himself, with the cavalry, visited most of the towns
in the Gallic province. Although there was no open war
any where but in Macedon, yet the Romans suspected Gentius,
king of Illyria. The senate, therefore, voted that eight
ships, fully equipped, should be sent from Brundusium to
Issa, to Caius Furius, lieutenant-general, who, with only two
vessels belonging to the inhabitants, held the government of
that island. In this squadron were embarked two thousand
soldiers, whom the pr&aelig;tor, Quintus M&aelig;nius, in pursuance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2042" id="Page_2042">Pg 2042</a></span>a decree of the senate, had raised in the quarter of Italy
opposite Illyria; and the consul Hostilius sent Appius Claudius,
with four thousand foot, into Illyria, to protect the
states that bordered on it. But Appius Claudius, not content
with the force which he brought with him, collected aid from
the allies, until he armed as many as eight thousand men of
different nations; and after overrunning all that country, took
post at Lychnidus, in the territory of the Dassaretians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g10" name="g10"></a>10</span>
Not far from this place was Uscana, a town generally
deemed part of the dominions of Perseus. It contained ten
thousand inhabitants, and a small party of Cretans, who
served as a garrison. From this place messengers came
secretly, to Claudius, telling him that &#8220;if he brought his
army nearer, there would be people ready to put the town
into his hands; and that it would be well worth his while;
for he would satiate with plunder not only his friends, but
also his soldiers.&#8221; The hopes presented to his avarice &#8220;blinded
his understanding to that degree, that he neither detained any
of those who came, nor required hostages as a pledge for his
security, in a business which was to be transacted clandestinely
and treacherously; neither did he send scouts to examine
matters, nor require an oath from the messengers; but, on the
day appointed, he left Lychnidus, and pitched his camp twelve
miles from the city, which was the object of his design. At
the fourth watch he set out, leaving about one thousand men
to guard the camp. His forces, in disorder, extending themselves
in a long irregular train, and few in number, as they
were separated by a mistake in the night, arrived in this state
at the city. Their carelessness increased when they saw not
a soldier on the walls. But as soon as they approached
within a weapon&#8217;s cast, a sally was made from two gates at
once. Besides the shout raised by the sallying party, a
tremendous noise was heard on the walls, composed of the
yells of women and the sound of brazen instruments, while
the rabble of the place, mixed with a multitude of slaves,
made the air resound with various cries. Such a number of
terrific circumstances, presented to them on all sides, had such
an effect, that the Romans were unable to support the first
onset of the sallying party; so that a greater number of them
were killed in the flight than in the battle, and scarcely two
thousand, with the lieutenant-general himself, effected their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2043" id="Page_2043">Pg 2043</a></span>
escape. The enemy had the greater opportunity of overtaking
the weary Romans, in proportion to their distance from the
camp. Appius, without even halting in the camp to collect
his scattered troops, which would have been the means of
saving many stragglers, led back, directly, to Lychnidus, the
remains of his unfortunate army.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g11" name="g11"></a>11</span>
These and other unfavourable occurrences in Macedon
were learned from Sextus Digitius, a military tribune, who
came to Rome to perform a sacrifice. The senate being apprehensive
on account of these advices of some greater disgrace
ensuing, deputed Marcus Fulvius Flaccus and Marcus
Caninius Rebilus to go to Macedon, and bring certain information
of what was going on there; at the same time ordering
that the consul, Aulus Hostilius, should summon the assembly
for the election of consuls, and arrange that it might be held
in the month of January, and should come home to the city as
soon as possible. In the mean time instructions were given
to the pr&aelig;tor, Marcus Recius, to call home to Rome, by proclamation,
all the senators from every part of Italy, except
such as were absent on public business; and it was resolved
that none of those who were in Rome should go further than
one mile from the city. All this was done pursuant to the
votes of the senate. The election of consuls was held on the
fifth day before the calends of February. Quintus Marcius
Philippus a second time, and Cneius Servilius C&aelig;pio, were
elected consuls. Three days after, Caius Decimius, Marcus
Claudius Marcellus, Caius Sulpicius Gallus, Caius Marcius
Figulus, Servius Cornelius Lentulus, and Publius Fonteius
Capito, were chosen pr&aelig;tors. Four other provinces in addition
to the two in the city were assigned to the pr&aelig;tors elect;
these provinces were Spain, Sardinia, Sicily, and the fleet.
Towards the end of February the deputies returned from
Macedon, and gave an account of the successful enterprises of
Perseus during the preceding summer, and of the great fears
which had taken possession of the allies of the Roman people,
on account of so many cities being reduced under the king&#8217;s
power. They reported, that &#8220;the consul&#8217;s troops were very
thin, in consequence of leave of absence being granted to great
numbers, with the view of gaining popularity; the blame of
which the consul laid upon the military tribunes, and they, on
the other hand, on the consul.&#8221; The senate understood them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2044" id="Page_2044">Pg 2044</a></span>
to make little of the disgrace sustained through the rashness
of Claudius, since they represented &#8220;that very few soldiers
of Italian extraction were lost, the greatest part being the
soldiers raised in that country by an irregular levy.&#8221; The
consuls elect received orders, immediately on entering into
office, to propose the affairs of Macedon to the consideration
of the senate; and Italy and Macedon were appointed their
provinces. An intercalation was made in the calendar of this
year, intercalary calends being reckoned on the third day after
the feast of Terminus. There died of the priests during this
year, Lucius Flaminius, <i>augur</i>, and two pontiffs, Lucius
Furius Philus, and Caius Livius Salinator. In the room of
Furius, the pontiffs chose Titus Manlius Torquatus, and in
that of Livius, Marcus Servilius.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g12" name="g12"></a>12</span>
In the beginning of the ensuing year, when the new
consuls, Quintus Marcius and Cneius Servilius, had proposed
the distribution of the provinces for consideration, the senate
voted that they should, without delay, either settle between
themselves about Macedon and Italy, or cast lots for them;
and that, before the lot should decide this matter, and while
the destination of each was uncertain, lest interest might have
any influence, the supplies of men, which the exigency required
for each province, should be ordered. Six thousand
Roman foot and six thousand of the Latin allies, two hundred
and fifty Roman horse and three hundred of the allies, were
voted for Macedon. The old soldiers were to be discharged,
so that there should be in each Roman legion no more than
six thousand foot and three hundred horse. The number of
Roman citizens, which the other consul was to enlist for a
reinforcement, was not precisely determined; there was only
this limitation mentioned, that he should raise two legions,
each of them to contain five thousand two hundred foot and
three hundred horse. A larger number of Latin infantry was
decreed to him than to his colleague; no less than ten thousand
foot, with six hundred horse. An order was given for raising
four other legions, to serve wherever occasion might require.
The consuls were not allowed the appointment of the military
tribunes; the people elected them. The confederates of the
Latin nation were ordered to furnish sixteen thousand foot
and one thousand horse. This force was intended only to be
kept in readiness, to march out should any exigency demand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2045" id="Page_2045">Pg 2045</a></span>
it. Macedon gave the senate most anxiety; they ordered,
that one thousand Roman citizens, of the rank of freed-men,
should be enlisted in Italy, as seamen, to man the fleet, and
the same number in Sicily; and instructions were given the
pr&aelig;tor, to whose lot the government of the latter province
fell, to the effect that he should take care to carry these over
to Macedon, to whatever place the fleet should be stationed at.
Three thousand Roman foot and three hundred horse were
voted to recruit the army in Spain. Then also the number of
men in each legion was limited to five thousand foot and three
hundred and thirty horse. Besides these, the pr&aelig;tor, to
whose lot Spain should fall, was ordered to levy from the
allies four thousand foot and three hundred horse.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g13" name="g13"></a>13</span>
I am well aware, that, through the same disregard of
religion, owing to which the men of the present day generally
believe that the gods never give portents of any future
events, no prodigies are now either reported to government,
or recorded in histories. But for my part, while I am writing
the transactions of ancient times, my sentiments, I know not
how, become antique; and a kind of religious awe prevents
me from considering events, which the men of those days, renowned
for wisdom, judged deserving of the attention of the
state and of public expiation, unworthy of being recorded in
my history. From Anagnia two prodigies were reported this
year: that a blazing torch was seen in the air; and that a cow
spoke, and was maintained at the public expense. About the
same time, at Minturn&aelig;, the sky appeared as in a blaze of
fire. At Reate, a shower of stones fell. At Cum&aelig;, the
image of Apollo, in the citadel, shed tears during three days
and three nights. In the city of Rome, two of the keepers of
the temples made strange announcements, one that in the
temple of Fortune, a snake, with a mane like that of a horse,
had been seen by many; the other, that, in the temple of
Fortuna Primigenia on the hill, a palm sprung up in the
court, and that a shower of blood fell in the middle of the
day. Two prodigies were not attended to: one, because it
happened in a place belonging to a private person; Titus
Marcius Figulus having reported, that a palm sprung up in
the inner court of his house; the other, because it occurred in
a foreign place, Fregell&aelig;,&mdash;where, in the house of Lucius
Arreus, a spear which he had bought for his son, who was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2046" id="Page_2046">Pg 2046</a></span>
soldier, burned, as was said, for more than two hours, and
notwithstanding the fire consumed none of it. The Sibylline
books were consulted by the decemvirs on account of the
public prodigies. They directed that the consuls should
sacrifice forty of the larger victims to the deities, whom they
pointed out; that a supplication should be performed; and
that all the magistrates should sacrifice victims of the larger
kinds in all the temples, and the people wear garlands. All
these acts were performed according to the injunctions of the
decemvirs.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g14" name="g14"></a>14</span>
Then the elections were held for the creation of censors.
Several of the first men in the state, including Caius Valerius
L&aelig;vinus, Lucius Postumius Albinus, Publius Mucius Sc&aelig;vola,
Marcus Junius Brutus, Caius Claudius Pulcher, and Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus, were candidates for this office. The
Roman people appointed the two last censors. As, on account
of the Macedonian war, greater attention was paid to holding
the levy than usual, the consuls made a complaint to the
senate against the plebeians, that even the younger men did
not obey their summons. But, in opposition to them, Caius
Sulpicius and Marcus Claudius, tribunes of the people,
pleaded in favour of the plebeians; asserting, that &#8220;the
levying of soldiers was a difficult task, not to the consuls
in general, but to such consuls as affected popularity; that no
man was made a soldier by them against his inclination; and
that the conscript fathers might be convinced of the truth of
this, the pr&aelig;tors, who in their office had less power and authority,
would, if it seemed good to the senate, complete the
levy.&#8221; That business was accordingly committed to the care
of the pr&aelig;tors by an unanimous vote of the senate, not without
great murmuring on the part of the consuls. The censors,
in order to forward it, published, in a general assembly, the
following notice: that &#8220;they would make it a rule in conducting
the survey, that, besides the common oath taken by all
citizens, the younger part should swear in this manner, when
challenged,&mdash;You are younger than forty-six years, and you
shall attend at the levy, pursuant to the edict of Caius Claudius
and Tiberius Sempronius, censors; and you shall attend
at the levy, as often as there shall be a levy held by any magistrate
during the aforesaid censors&#8217; continuance in office, if
you shall not have been already enlisted.&#8221; Also as there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2047" id="Page_2047">Pg 2047</a></span>
a report, that many men belonging to the legions in Macedon
were absent from the army on furloughs, which did not limit the
time, and were granted by the commanders to ingratiate themselves
with the soldiers, they issued a proclamation concerning
all who had been draughted for Macedon in the consulate of
Publius &AElig;lius and Caius Popilius, or since that period; that
&#8220;such as were in Italy should, after being first registered by
them in the survey, repair within thirty days to the province in
which they served; and that, if any were under the power of a
father or grandfather, the names of such should be notified to
them. That they would also make inquiry into the cases of the
soldiers who had been discharged; and that they would order
those, whose discharge should appear to have been obtained
through favour, before the regular number of campaigns were
served, to be enlisted again.&#8221; In consequence of this proclamation,
and letters from the censors being dispersed through
the market-towns and villages, such multitudes of young men
flocked to Rome, that the extraordinary crowd was even inconvenient
to the city. Besides enrolling those whom it was
necessary to send as a reinforcement for the armies, four legions
were raised by the pr&aelig;tor, Caius Sulpicius, and the
levies were completed within eleven days.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g15" name="g15"></a>15</span>
The consuls then cast lots for their provinces; the pr&aelig;tors,
on account of the civil jurisdiction, had determined theirs
earlier in the season. The civil jurisdiction had fallen to
Caius Sulpicius; the foreign, to Caius Decimius; Marcus
Claudius Marcellus had obtained by lot Spain; Servius Cornelius
Lentulus, Sicily; Publius Fonteius Capito, Sardinia;
and Caius Marcius Figulus had received the command of the
fleet. In the arrangement of the consular provinces, Italy fell
to Cneius Servilius, and Macedon to Quintus Marcius; and
the latter set out as soon as the Latin festival could be celebrated.
C&aelig;pio then desired the senate to direct which two of
the new legions he should take with him into Gaul; when they
ordered, that the pr&aelig;tors Caius Sulpicius and Marcus Claudius
should give the consul such of the legions, which they
had raised, as they should think fit. The latter, highly offended
at a consul being subjected to the will of pr&aelig;tors, adjourned
the senate; and standing at the tribunal of the pr&aelig;tors,
demanded, that pursuant to the decree, they should assign
him two legions; but the pr&aelig;tors left the consul to his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2048" id="Page_2048">Pg 2048</a></span>
discretion in selecting them. The censors then called over the
list of the senate. Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus was now, by the
third censors, chosen prince of the senate. Seven were expelled
that body. In making the survey of the people, they
discovered from the rolls how many of the soldiers belonging
to the army in Macedonia were absent, and obliged them all
to return to that province. They inquired into the cases of
the men who had been discharged; and, when any of their
discharges appeared irregular in respect of time, they put the
following oath to them: &#8220;Do you truly swear, that you
will, without deceit or evasion, return into the province of
Macedon, according to the edict of the censors, Caius Claudius
and Tiberius Sempronius?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g16" name="g16"></a>16</span>
In the review of the knights their censorship was very
severe and harsh: they deprived many of their horses; and
after giving offence to the equestrian order in this matter,
they inflamed the general displeasure to a higher degree by
an edict, in which they ordered, that &#8220;no person who had
farmed the public revenues or taxes from the censors Quintus
Fulvius and Aulus Postumius, should attend their sale, or
have any partnership or connexion in the contracts then to be
made.&#8221; When the former tax-contractors could not prevail on
the senate, by their frequent complaints, to check the power
of the censors, at length they found a patron of their cause in
Publius Rutilius, a plebeian tribune, who was incensed against
the censors in consequence of a dispute about a private concern.
They had ordered a client of his, a freed-man, to throw
down a wall, which stood opposite to a public building in the
Sacred Street, because it was built on ground belonging to the
public. The tribunes were appealed to by the citizen. When
none of them would interfere, except Rutilius, the censors
were sent to seize the property of the citizen, and imposed a
fine on him in a public assembly. When the present dispute
broke out, and the old revenue-farmers had recourse to the
tribunes, a bill was suddenly promulgated under the name of
one of the tribunes, that &#8220;with regard to the public revenues
and taxes, which Caius Claudius and Tiberius Sempronius
should have hired out, all contracts made by them should be
null and void: that they should all be let anew, and that every
person, without distinction, should be at liberty to bid for and
take them.&#8221; The tribune appointed the day for an assembly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2049" id="Page_2049">Pg 2049</a></span>
to vote on this bill. When the day came, and the censors
stood forth to argue against the order, there was deep silence
while Gracchus addressed them: when the voice of Claudius
was drowned in the murmurs, he directed the crier to cause
silence, that he might be heard. When this was done, the
tribune, complaining that the assembly which he had summoned
was taken out of his rule, and that he was reduced to a
private capacity, retired from the Capitol, where the assembly
met. Next day he raised a violent commotion. In the first
place, he declared the property of Tiberius Gracchus forfeited
to the gods, because he, by fining and seizing the goods of a
person who had appealed to a tribune, and by refusing to
admit the tribune&#8217;s right of protesting, had reduced him to a
private capacity. He instituted a criminal process against
Caius Claudius because he had summoned the assembly away
from him, and declared his intention of prosecuting both the
censors for treason; and he demanded of Caius Sulpicius, the
city pr&aelig;tor, that he would fix a day for an assembly to try
them. As the censors offered no objection to the people passing
their sentence on them as soon as they pleased, their trial
for treason was fixed to come the eighth and seventh days
before the calends of October. The censors went up immediately
to the temple of Liberty, where they sealed the books
of the public accounts, shut up the office, and dismissed the
clerks; affirming, that they would do no kind of public business
until the sentence of the people was passed on them.
Claudius was first brought to trial; and after eight out of the
eighteen centuries of knights, and many others of the first
class, had given sentence against him, the principal men in
the state, immediately taking off their gold rings, in the sight
of the people, put on mourning, in order that they might suppliantly
solicit the commons in his favour. Yet, it is said,
that Gracchus was the chief means of making a change in their
sentiments; for when shouts arose from the commons on all
sides that Gracchus was in no danger, he took a formal oath,
that if his colleague were condemned, he would be his companion
in exile, without waiting for their judgment concerning
himself. After all, the case of the accused was so near
being desperate, that the votes of eight centuries only were
wanting to condemn him. When Claudius was acquitted, the
tribune said, that he would not delay Gracchus.</p>

This year, when the ambassadors of the Aquileians
demanded that the number of the colonists should be increased,
one thousand five hundred families were enrolled by a decree
of the senate; and Titus Annius Luscus, Publius Decius Subulo,
and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, were appointed commissioners
to conduct them. During the same year, Caius
Popilius and Cneius Octavius, who had been sent ambassadors
into Greece, read, first at Thebes, and afterwards carried about
to all the other states of Peloponnesus, a decree, ordering,
that &#8220;no person should furnish the Roman magistrates with
any thing for the use of the war, except what the senate
should determine.&#8221; This afforded the allies a pleasing confidence,
with regard to the future also, that they would be relieved
from the heavy burdens and expenses, by which they
were exhausted, in consequence of the various demands of those
magistrates. In the council of Achaia, held at &AElig;gium, the ambassadors
spoke, and were heard with sentiments of mutual
esteem and affection; and then, leaving that faithful nation
in confident assurance of lasting prosperity, they crossed over
to &AElig;tolia. No civil war had yet broke out in that country;
but all places were full of suspicion and mutual recrimination.
The ambassadors having demanded hostages on account of
these disputes, set out from this place to Acarnania, without
putting an end to the evil. The Acarnanians gave to the
ambassadors an audience of their general council at Thyrium.
Here, too, there was a struggle between opposite factions;
some of the nobles required that garrisons might be placed in
their cities, to protect them against the madness of those who
were endeavouring to bring the nation over to the Macedonians;
and others objected to the measure, lest peaceful and allied
cities should receive such an insult, as was usually offered
only to towns taken in war, or engaged in hostilities. Their
objection was reckoned reasonable. The ambassadors returned
to Larissa, to Hostilius, for by him they had been sent.
He kept Octavius with him, and sent Popilius, with about a
thousand soldiers, into winter quarters at Ambracia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g18" name="g18"></a>18</span>
Perseus did not venture, at the commencement of winter,
to go out of the limits of Macedon, lest the Romans
might make an irruption into the kingdom by some unguarded
quarter; but on the approach of the winter solstice, when the
depth of the snow renders the mountains between it and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2051" id="Page_2051">Pg 2051</a></span>
Thessaly impassable, he thought the season favourable for
crushing the hopes and spirits of his neighbours, lest any
danger should be lurking there, while his attention was turned
to the Romans; since Cotys afforded him security in the direction
of Thrace, and Cephalus, by his sudden revolt from the
Romans, freed him from uneasiness on the side of Epirus, and
his late expedition had subdued the Dardanians, he considered
that Macedon was only exposed on the side next to
Illyria, the Illyrians themselves being in motion, and having
offered a free passage to the Romans: hoping, however, that
if he reduced the nearest tribes of Illyrians, Gentius himself,
who had long been wavering, might be brought into alliance
with him, he set out at the head of ten thousand foot, the
greater part of whom were soldiers of the phalanx, two
thousand light infantry, and five hundred horse, and proceeded
to Stubera. Having there supplied himself with corn sufficient
for many days, and ordered every requisite for besieging
towns to be sent after him, he encamped on the third day before
Uscana, the largest city in the Penestian country. Before
he employed force, he sent emissaries to sound the dispositions,
sometimes of the commanders of the garrison, sometimes of
the inhabitants; for, besides some troops of Illyrians, there
was a Roman garrison in the place. When his emissaries
brought back no friendly message, he resolved to attack the
town, and made an attempt to take it by a line of circumvallation
formed of troops; but though his men, relieving
one another, continued without intermission, either by day or
night, some to apply ladders to the walls, others to attempt
to set fire to the gates, yet the defenders of the city sustained
that shock, for they had hopes that the Macedonians
would not be able to endure any longer the severity of the
winter in the open field; and besides, that the king would not
have so long a respite from the war with Rome, that he would
be able to stay there. But, when they saw the machines in
motion, and towers erected, their resolution was overcome;
for, besides that they were unequal to a contest with his
force, they had not a sufficient store of corn, or any other
necessary, as they had not expected a siege. Therefore when
they had no hopes of being able to hold out, Caius Carvilius
Spoletinus and Caius Afranius were sent by the Roman garrison
to request from Perseus, first, to allow the troops to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2052" id="Page_2052">Pg 2052</a></span>
march out with their arms, and to carry their effects with
them; and then, if they could not obtain that, to receive his
promise of their lives and liberty. The king promised more
generously than he performed; for, after desiring them to
march out with their effects, the first thing he did was to take
away their arms. As soon as they left the city, both the cohort
of Illyrians, five hundred in number, and the inhabitants of
Uscana, immediately surrendered themselves and the city.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g19" name="g19"></a>19</span>
Perseus, placing a garrison in Uscana, carried away to
Stubera the whole multitude of prisoners, almost equal to his
army in number. He then distributed the Romans, who
amounted to four thousand, besides officers, among several
cities, to be kept in custody; and, having sold the Uscanians
and Illyrians, led back his army to Penestia, to reduce the city
of O&aelig;neus: the town is advantageously situated in other
respects, and besides, in that direction there is a passage into
the country of the Labeatians, where Gentius was king. As
he passed by a fort, named Draudacum, which was full of
men, one of the persons, well acquainted with the country,
told him that &#8220;there was no use in taking O&aelig;neus unless he
had Draudacum in his power; for the latter was situated
more advantageously in every respect.&#8221; When his army was
brought against it, the garrison surrendered unanimously and
at once. Encouraged by the surrender of this place, which
was earlier than he hoped, and perceiving what terrors his
march diffused, by taking advantage of the like fears, he reduced
eleven other forts to submission. Against a very few
he had occasion to use force; the rest submitted voluntarily;
among whom one thousand five hundred Roman soldiers were
taken, who had been divided among the Roman garrisons.
Carvilius Spoletinus was very serviceable to him in his conferences
with the garrison, by declaring that no severity had
been shown to his own party. At length he arrived at O&aelig;neus,
which could not be taken without a regular siege. The
town possessed a much greater number of young men than
the others, and was strong in its fortifications. It was enclosed
on one side by a river called Artatus, and on another
by a very high mountain of difficult access; these circumstances
gave the inhabitants courage to make resistance.
Perseus, having drawn lines of circumvallation, began, on
the higher ground, to raise a mound, which he intended should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2053" id="Page_2053">Pg 2053</a></span>
exceed the wall in height. By the time that this work was
completed, the besieged, in their many actions, when sallying
out to defend their works, or to obstruct those of the enemy,
had lost great numbers by various chances; while the survivors
were rendered useless by wounds, and by continual
labour both in the day and night. As soon as the mound was
brought close to the wall, the royal cohort (the men of which
are called Nicators) rushed from it into the town, while an
assault was made by scalade in many places at once. All the
males, who had reached the age of puberty, were put to the
sword, their wives and children were thrown into confinement,
and every thing else was given as booty to the soldiers.
Returning thence victorious to Stubera, he sent, as ambassadors
to Gentius,&mdash;Pleuratus, an Illyrian, who lived in exile
at his court, and Ad&aelig;us, a Macedonian, from Ber&#339;a. He
gave them instructions to represent his exploits against the
Romans and Dardanians during the preceding summer and
winter, and to add the recent operations of his winter campaign
in Illyria, and to exhort Gentius to unite with him and
the Macedonians in a treaty of friendship.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g20" name="g20"></a>20</span>
They crossed over the top of Mount Scordus, and
through desert tracts of Illyria, which the Macedonians had
laid waste, for the purpose of preventing the Dardanians
from passing easily into Illyria or Macedon; and, at length,
after undergoing prodigious fatigue, arrived at Scodra. King
Gentius was at Lissus; to which place the ambassadors were
invited, and received a favourable audience while stating their
instructions, but obtained an indecisive answer: that &#8220;he
wanted not inclination to go to war with the Romans, but
was in extreme want of money to enable him to enter on
such an undertaking, though he wished to do so.&#8221; This
answer they brought to the king at Stubera, whilst he was
engaged in selling the Illyrian prisoners. The same ambassadors
were immediately sent back, with an accession to their
numbers in Glaucias, one of his body guards, but without any
mention of money; the only thing by which the needy barbarian
could be induced to take a part in the war. Then
Perseus, after ravaging Ancyra, led back his army once more
into Penestia; and having strengthened the garrison of Uscana,
and the surrounding fortresses which he had taken, he
retired into Macedon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2054" id="Page_2054">Pg 2054</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g21" name="g21"></a>21</span>
Lucius C&aelig;lius, a Roman lieutenant-general, commanded
at that time in Illyria. While the king was in that country
he did not venture to stir; but, on his departure, he made an
attempt to recover Uscana, in Penestia; in which being repulsed,
with great loss, by the Macedonian garrison, he led
back his forces to Lychnidus. In a short time after he sent
Marcus Trebellius Fregellanus, with a very strong force, into
Penestia, to receive hostages from the cities which had faithfully
remained in friendship. He ordered him, also, to march
on to the Parthinians, who had likewise covenanted to give
hostages, which were received from both nations without any
trouble: those of the Penestians were sent to Apollonia;
those of the Parthinians, to Dyrrachium, then more generally
called by the Greeks Epidamnus. Appius Claudius, wishing
to repair the disgrace which he had suffered in Illyria, made
an attack on Phanote, a fortress of Epirus; bringing with
him, besides the Roman troops, Athamanian and Thesprotian
auxiliaries, to the amount of six thousand men; nor did he
gain any advantage to recompense his exertion, for Clevas,
who had been left there with a strong garrison, effectually
defended the place. Perseus marched to Elimea, and, after
reviewing his army in the vicinity of that town, led it to
Stratus, in compliance with an invitation of the Epirotes.
Stratus was then the strongest city in &AElig;tolia. It stands on
the Ambracian Gulf, near the river Inachus. Thither he
marched with ten thousand foot and three hundred horse;
for, on account of the narrowness and ruggedness of the roads,
he led a smaller army than he would otherwise have done.
On the third day he came to Mount Citium, which he could
scarcely climb over, by reason of the depth of the snow, and
with difficulty found even a place for his camp. Leaving that
spot, rather because he could not conveniently stay, than that
either the road or the weather was tolerable, the army, after
suffering severe hardships, which fell heaviest on the beasts
of burden, encamped on the second day at the temple of Jupiter,
called Nic&aelig;us. After a very long march thence, he
halted at the river Aracthus, being detained there by the depth
of the water, during the time in which a bridge was being
constructed; he then led over his army, and, having proceeded
one day&#8217;s march, met Archidamus, an &AElig;tolian of distinction,
who proposed delivering Stratus into his hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2055" id="Page_2055">Pg 2055</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g22" name="g22"></a>22</span>
On that day Perseus encamped at the borders of the
&AElig;tolian territory; and, on the next, arrived before Stratus,
where, pitching his camp near the river Achelous, he expected
that the &AElig;tolians would come in crowds to put themselves
under his protection; but on the contrary, he found the gates
shut, and discovered that the very night on which he arrived,
a Roman garrison, under Caius Popilius, lieutenant-general,
had been received into the town. The nobles, who, induced
by the authority of Archidamus, while he was present, had
invited the king, as soon as he went out to meet Perseus had
become less zealous, and had given an opportunity to the
opposite faction to call in Popilius, with one thousand foot,
from Ambracia. At the same juncture came also Dinarchus,
general of the &AElig;tolian cavalry, with six hundred foot and
one hundred horse. It was well known that he came to
Stratus intending to act with Perseus; but that, with the
change of fortune, he had changed his mind, and joined the
Romans, against whom he had come. Nor was Popilius less
on his guard than he ought to be among people of such fickle
tempers. He immediately took into his own keeping the keys
of the gates, with the direction of the guard of the walls, and
removed Dinarchus and the &AElig;tolians, together with the
young men of Stratus, into the citadel, under pretence of
garrisoning it. Perseus sounded the garrison, by addressing
them from the eminences that hung over the upper part of the
city, and finding that they were obstinate, and even kept him
at a distance with weapons, removed his camp to the other
side of the river Petitarus, about five miles from the town:
there he held a council, wherein Archidamus and the refugees
from Epirus were for detaining him there; but the Macedonian
nobles were of opinion that he ought not to fight against the
severity of the season without having magazines of provisions;
in which case the besiegers would feel a scarcity sooner than
the besieged, especially as the winter quarters of the enemy
were at no great distance: being deterred by these considerations,
he removed his camp into Aperantia. The Aperantians,
in consequence of the great interest and influence which
Archidamus possessed among them, submitted to Perseus
with universal consent; and Archidamus himself was appointed
their governor, with a body of eight hundred soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="g23" name="g23"></a>23</span>
The king then returned into Macedon with his men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2056" id="Page_2056">Pg 2056</a></span>
and horses, not less harassed than they had been in their
advance to Stratus. However, the report of Perseus&#8217;s march
to that place obliged Appius to raise the siege of Phanote.
Clevas, with a body of active young men, pursued him to the
foot of some mountains, which formed a defile almost impassable,
killed one thousand men of his disordered troops, and
took two hundred prisoners. Appius, when he got clear of
the defile, encamped for a few days in a plain named Meleon.
Meanwhile Clevas, being joined by Philostratus, who was
invested with the chief power among the nation of the
Epirotes, proceeded over the mountains into the lands of
Antigonea. The Macedonians setting out to plunder, Philostratus,
with his division, posted himself in ambush, in a place
where he could not be seen. When the troops at Antigonea
sallied out against the straggling plunderers, they pursued
them in their flight with too great eagerness, until they precipitated
themselves into the valley which was beset by the
enemy, who killed one thousand, and made about one hundred
prisoners. Being thus successful every where, they encamped
near the post of Appius, in order to prevent the Roman army
from offering any violence to their allies. Appius, as he was
wasting time there to no purpose, dismissed the Chaonian and
other Epirotes, and with his Italian soldiers marched back to
Illyria; then sending the troops to their several winter quarters,
in the confederate cities of the Parthinians, he went home
to Rome on account of a sacrifice. Perseus recalled from the
nation of the Penestians one thousand foot and two hundred
horse, and sent them to garrison Cassandria. His ambassadors
returned from Gentius with the same answer as before.
Still he did not cease from soliciting him, but sent embassy
after embassy; yet, notwithstanding that he was sensible of
the powerful support he would find in Gentius, the Macedonian
could not prevail on himself to expend money on the
business, although it was to him a question of vital importance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Quintus Marcius Philippus, the consul, penetrates into Macedonia through
the rugged passes, and takes several cities. The Rhodians send an embassy
to Rome, threatening to aid Perseus, unless the Romans made
peace with him. This act was received with general indignation. Lucius
&AElig;milius Paullus, the consul, sent against Perseus, defeats him, and reduces
all Macedonia to subjection. Before the engagement, Caius Sulpicius
Gallus, a military tribune, foretells an eclipse of the moon, and
warns the soldiers not to be alarmed at that phenomenon. Gentius, king
of Illyria, vanquished by Anicius the pr&aelig;tor, and sent prisoner, together
with his wife and children, to Rome. Ambassadors from Ptolemy and
Cleopatra, king and queen of Egypt, complain of Antiochus making war

<hr />

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h1" name="h1"></a>1</span>
<span class="smcap">Early</span> in the spring which succeeded the winter in
which these transactions took place, the consul, Quintus Marcius
Philippus, set out from Rome, with five thousand men,
whom he was to carry over to reinforce his legions, and arrived
at Brundusium. Marcus Popilius, of consular rank,
and other young men of equal dignity, accompanied him, in
the capacity of military tribunes for the legions in Macedonia.
Nearly at the same time, Caius Marcius Figulus, the pr&aelig;tor,
whose province was the fleet, came to Brundusium; and, both
sailing from Italy, made Corcyra on the second day, and Actium,
a port of Acarnania, on the third. The consul, then,
disembarking at Ambracia, proceeded towards Thessaly by
land. The pr&aelig;tor, doubling Cape Leucate, sailed into the gulf
of Corinth; then, leaving his ships at Creusa, he went by land
also through the middle of B&#339;otia, and, by a quick journey of
one day, came to the fleet at Chalcis. Aulus Hostilius at that
time lay encamped in Thessaly, near Pal&aelig;pharsalus; and
though he had performed no warlike act of any consequence,
yet he had reformed his troops from a state of dissolute licentiousness,
and brought them to exact military discipline; had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2058" id="Page_2058">Pg 2058</a></span>
faithfully consulted the interest of the allies, and defended
them from every kind of injury. On hearing of his successor&#8217;s
approach, he carefully inspected the arms, men, and horses;
and then, with the army in complete order, he marched out to
meet the consul. Their first meeting was such as became their
own dignity and the Roman character; and in transacting
business afterwards, <i>they preserved the greatest harmony and
propriety</i>.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> The proconsul, addressing himself to the troops,
<i>exhorted them to behave with courage, and with due respect
to the orders of their commander. He then recommended
them, in warm terms, to the consul, and, as soon as he had
despatched the necessary affairs, set off for Rome.</i><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> A few
days after, the consul made a speech to his soldiers, which began
with the unnatural murder which Perseus had perpetrated
on his brother, and meditated against his father; he then
mentioned &#8220;his acquisition of the kingdom by nefarious practices;
his poisonings and murders; his abominable attempt to
assassinate Eumenes; the injuries he had committed against
the Roman people; and his plundering the cities of their
allies, in violation of the treaty.&#8221; &#8220;How detestable such proceedings
were in the sight of the gods, Perseus would feel,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;in the issue of his affairs; for the gods always favoured
righteous and honourable dealings; by means of which
the Roman people had risen to so great an exaltation.&#8221; He
next compared the strength of the Roman people, which now
embraced the whole world, with that of Macedonia, and the
armies of the one with those of the other; and then added,
&#8220;How much more powerful armies of Philip and Antiochus
had been conquered by forces not more numerous than the
present!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h2" name="h2"></a>2</span>
Having animated the minds of his soldiers by such exhortations,
he began to consult on a general plan of operations
for the campaign; being joined by the pr&aelig;tor, Caius Marcius,
who, after receiving the command of the fleet, came thither
from Chalcis. It was resolved not to waste time by delaying
longer in Thessaly; but to decamp immediately, and advance
thence into Macedonia; and that the pr&aelig;tor should exert
himself to the utmost, that the fleet might appear, at the same
time, on the enemy&#8217;s coasts. The pr&aelig;tor then having been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2059" id="Page_2059">Pg 2059</a></span>sent away, the consul, having ordered the soldiers to carry
with them a month&#8217;s provisions, struck his tents, on the tenth
day after he received the command of the army, and proceeded
one day&#8217;s march. He then called together his guides,
and ordered them to explain, in the presence of the council,
by what road each of them proposed to lead him; then, having
dismissed them, he asked the opinion of the council, as to
what route he should prefer. Some advised the road through
Pythium; others, that over the Cambunian mountains, by
which the consul Hostilius had marched the year before; while
others, again, preferred that which passed by the side of the
Lake Ascuris. There was yet before him a considerable
length of road common to each of these routes; the further
consideration of this matter was therefore postponed until
they should encamp near the place where the roads diverged.
He then marched into Perrh&aelig;bia, and posted himself between
Azorus and Doliche, in order to consider again which was the
preferable road. In the mean time, Perseus, understanding
that the enemy was marching towards him, but unable to
guess what route he might take, resolved to secure all the
passes by guards. To the top of the Cambunian mountains,
called by the natives Volustana, he sent ten thousand light infantry,
under the command of Asclepiodotus; ordering Hippias,
with a detachment of twelve thousand Macedonians, to
guard the pass called Lapathus, near a fort which stood over
the Lake Ascuris. He himself, with the rest of his forces, lay
for some time in camp at Dium; but afterwards, as if he had
lost the use of his judgment, and was incapable of forming
any plan, he used to gallop along the coast, with a party of
light horse, sometimes to Heracleum, sometimes to Phila, and
then return with the same speed to Dium.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h3" name="h3"></a>3</span>
By this time the consul had determined to march
through the pass near Octolophus, where, as we have mentioned,
the camp of the king formerly stood. But he deemed
it prudent to despatch before him four thousand men, to secure
such places as might be useful: the command of this party
was given to Marcus Claudius, and Quintus Marcius the consul&#8217;s
son. The main body followed close after; but the road
was so steep, rough, and craggy, that the advanced party of
light troops, with great difficulty, effected in two days a march
of fifteen miles; and then encamped. They call the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2060" id="Page_2060">Pg 2060</a></span>
which they took, the tower of Eudicru. Next day they advanced
seven miles; and, having seized on a hill at a small
distance from the enemy&#8217;s camp, sent back a message to the
consul, that &#8220;they had come up with the enemy; and
had taken post in a place which was safe and convenient
in every respect; urging him to join them with all possible
speed.&#8221; This message came to the consul at the Lake Ascuris,
at a time when he was full of anxiety, on account of
the badness of the road on which he had entered, and
for the fate of the small force he had sent forward into the
midst of the posts of the enemy. His spirits were therefore
greatly revived; and, soon effecting a junction of all his
forces, he pitched his camp on the side of the hill that had
been seized, where the ground was the most commodious.
This hill was so high as to afford a wide-extended prospect
presenting to their eyes, at one view, not only the enemy&#8217;s
camp, which was little more than a mile distant, but the whole
extent of territory to Dium and Phila, together with a large
tract of the sea-coast; circumstances which greatly enlivened
the courage of the soldiers, giving them so near a view of the
grand theatre of the war, of all the king&#8217;s forces, and of the
country of the enemy. So eager were they, that they pressed
the consul to lead them on directly to the enemy&#8217;s camp;
but, after the fatigue that they had suffered on the road, one
day was set apart for repose. On the third day, the consul,
leaving one half of his troops to guard the camp, drew out
his forces against the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h4" name="h4"></a>4</span>
Hippias had been sent by the king, a short time before,
to maintain that pass; and having employed himself, since he
first saw the Roman camp on the hill, in preparing his men&#8217;s
minds for a battle, he now went forth to meet the consul&#8217;s
army as it advanced. The Romans came out to battle with
light armour, as did the enemy; light troops being the fittest
to commence the engagement. As soon as they met,
therefore, they instantly discharged their javelins, and many
wounds were given and received on both sides in a disorderly
kind of conflict; but few of either party were killed. This
only roused their courage for the following day, when they
would have engaged with more numerous forces, and with
greater animosity, had there been room to form a line; but
the summit of the mountain was contracted into a ridge so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2061" id="Page_2061">Pg 2061</a></span>
narrow, as scarcely to allow space for three files in front; so
that, while but few were fighting, the greater part, especially
such as carried heavy arms, stood mere spectators of the fight.
The light troops even ran through the hollows of the hill, and
attacked the flanks of the light-armed troops of the enemy;
and alike through even and uneven places, sought to come to
action. That day, greater numbers were wounded than killed,
and night put a stop to the dispute. The Roman general was
greatly at a loss how to proceed on the third day; for to remain
on that naked hill was impossible, and he could not
return without disgrace, and even danger, if the enemy with
the advantage of the ground, should press on his troops in their
retreat: he had therefore no other plan left than to improve his
bold attempt, by persevering resolution, which sometimes, in the
issue, proves the wiser course. He had, in fact, brought himself
into such a situation, that if he had had to deal with an enemy
like the ancient kings of Macedon, he might have suffered a
severe defeat. But while the king, with his horsemen, ran up
and down the shore at Dium; and, though at a distance of twelve
miles, he was almost within hearing of the shout and noise of his
forces who were engaged, neither strengthened his forces by
sending up fresh men to relieve the weary, nor, what was most
material, appeared himself in the action; the Roman general,
notwithstanding that he was above sixty years old, and unwieldy
through corpulency, performed actively every duty of a commander.
He persisted with extraordinary resolution in his bold
undertaking; and, leaving Popilius to guard the summit, marched
across, through trackless places, having sent forward a party to
open a road. Attalus and Misagenes, with the auxiliary troops
of their own nations, were ordered to protect them, while clearing
the way through the forests. He himself, keeping the cavalry
and baggage before him, closed the rear with the legions.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h5" name="h5"></a>5</span>
In descending the mountain, the men suffered inexpressible
fatigue, besides the frequent falling of the cattle and their
loads, so that, before they had advanced quite four miles, they
began to think that their most eligible plan would be to return,
if they could, by the way they had come. The elephants
caused almost as much confusion among the troops as an enemy
could; for, when they came to impassable steeps, they threw
off their riders, and set up such a hideous roar, as spread terror
through all, especially among the horses, until a method<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2062" id="Page_2062">Pg 2062</a></span>
was contrived for bringing them down. They fastened in the
earth, in the line of descent, some way from the top, two long,
strong posts, distant from each other a little more than the
breadth of the animal, on which were fastened beams thirty
feet long, so as to form a kind of bridge, and covered it with
earth; after a little intermediate space, a second and similar
bridge was formed; then a third bridge, with several others
one after another, where the rocks were precipitous. The
elephant walked forward on solid footing upon the bridge; but
before he came to the end, the posts underneath were cut, and
the bridge falling, obliged him to slide down gently to the beginning
of the next bridge, which some of them performed
standing, others on their haunches. When they arrived at the
level of another bridge, they were again carried down, by its
falling in like manner; and so on until they came to more level
ground. The Romans advanced that day scarcely more than
seven miles; and even of this journey little was performed on
foot. Their method of proceeding in general was rolling themselves
down, together with their arms and other encumbrances,
with every kind of discomfort; insomuch, that even their commander,
who led them such a march, did not deny, but that
tho whole army might have been cut off by a small party.
During the night, they arrived at a small plain; but, as it was
hemmed in on every side, there was no opportunity of discovering
whether it was a position of danger or not. However, as
they had, beyond their expectation, at length found good footing,
they judged it necessary to wait, during the next day, in
that deep valley for Popilius, and the forces left behind with
him; who, though the enemy gave them no disturbance from any
quarter, suffered severely from the difficulties of the ground,&mdash;as
if they had been harassed by an enemy. These having
joined the main body, the whole proceeded, on the third day,
through a pass called by the natives Callipeuce. On the fourth
day they marched down through places equally trackless, but
more cleverly in consequence of their experience, and with
more comfortable hopes, as they saw no enemy any where,
and as they were coming nearer to the sea, into the plains,
where they pitched their camp of infantry between Heracleum
and Libethrus, the greater part being posted on hills, the rest
occupying a valley and part of the plain where the cavalry
encamped.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2063" id="Page_2063">Pg 2063</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h6" name="h6"></a>6</span>
The king, it is said, was bathing, when he was informed
of the enemy&#8217;s approach; on hearing which, he started up
from his seat, and rushed out in a fright, crying out, that he
was conquered without a battle; and afterwards, in a state of
great perturbation, amidst plans and orders dictated by fear,
he recalled two most intimate friends from his garrisons, and
sent one to Pella, where his treasure was lodged, and the other
to Parthus, and opened all the passes to the invasion of the
enemy. He himself, having suddenly removed from Dium all
the gilded statues, that they might not fall a prey to the
enemy, ordered all the inhabitants to remove to Pydna; and
thus made the conduct of the consul, in venturing into a
situation out of which he could not retreat without the enemy&#8217;s
permission, although it might have been deemed rash and
inconsiderate, to wear the appearance of judicious boldness.
For there were only two passes through which the Romans
could remove from their present situation; one through Tempe
into Thessaly, the other by Dium into Macedonia; and both
these were occupied by parties of the king&#8217;s troops. So that
if an intrepid commander had, only for ten days, maintained
his ground, without yielding to the first appearance of an approaching
terror, the Romans could neither have retreated by
Tempe into Thessaly, nor have had any road open for the conveyance
of provisions to their position. For Tempe is a pass
of such a nature, that even supposing no obstruction was given
by an enemy, it is difficult to get through it; being so narrow
for the distance of five miles, that there is barely room for a
loaded horse to pass: the precipices, also, on both sides, are so
abrupt, that it is scarcely possible to look down from them,
without a dizziness alike of the eyes and the mind; while the
roaring and depth of the river Peneus, flowing through the
middle of the glen, increases the terrific effect. This defile,
in its nature so dangerous, was guarded by parties of the
king&#8217;s troops, stationed in four different places: one near
Gonnus, at the first entrance; another in an impregnable fortress
at Condylos; a third near Lapathus, in a place called
Charax; and the fourth on the road itself about midway,
where the valley is narrowest, and might have been easily
defended even by half a score men. All possibility either of
retreating, or of receiving provisions through Tempe, being
cut off, the Romans, in order to return, must have crossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2064" id="Page_2064">Pg 2064</a></span>
over the same mountains from which they came down; but
even though they might have been able to effect this by passing
unobserved, they never could have accomplished it openly,
and while the enemy kept possession of the heights; and besides,
the difficulties which they had already experienced
would have precluded every hope of the kind. In this rash
enterprise they would have no other plan left than to force
their way into Macedonia, through the midst of the enemy
posted at Dium; and if the gods had not deprived the king of
his understanding, this would have been extremely difficult
For the space between the foot of Mount Olympus and the
sea is not much more than a mile in breadth; one half of
which is taken up by the mouth of the river Baphirus, which
forms a large morass, and, of the remaining plain, a great
share is occupied by the town and the temple of Jupiter: the
rest, being a very small space, might have been shut up with
a trench and rampart of no great length; or, so great was
the plenty of stones and timber on the spot, that a wall might
have been drawn across, and towers erected. But the king&#8217;s
judgment was so entirely blinded by the sudden fright, that
he reflected not upon any one of these circumstances; on the
contrary, he evacuated all his strong posts, and leaving them
open to the enemy, fled back to Pydna.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h7" name="h7"></a>7</span>
The consul, perceiving in the folly and sloth of the
enemy a most favourable prospect, not only of safety, but of
success, sent back a messenger to Larissa, with orders to Spurius
Lucretius to seize on the deserted forts about Tempe;
then, sending forward Popilius, to examine all the passes round
Dium, and learning that all was clear, he marched in two days
to that town, ordering the camp to be fixed under the walls of
the temple, that no violation might be offered to that sacred
place. He went himself into the city; and seeing it, though
not large, yet highly ornamented with public buildings and
abundance of statues, and remarkably well fortified, he could
scarcely believe that there was not some stratagem concealed in
the abandonment of such important advantages without cause.
He waited therefore one day to examine all the country round;
then he decamped; and supposing that he should find plenty
of corn in Pieria, advanced to a river called the Mytis. On
the day following, continuing his march, he received the voluntary
surrender of the city of Agass&aelig;; whereupon, in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2065" id="Page_2065">Pg 2065</a></span>
to gain the good opinion of the rest of the Macedonians, he
contented himself with receiving hostages, assuring the inhabitants,
that he would leave them their city without a garrison,
and that they should live free from taxes, and under
their own laws. Proceeding thence one day&#8217;s march, he encamped
at the river Ascordus; but, finding that the farther he
removed from Thessaly, the greater was the scarcity of every
thing, he returned to Dium; which clearly demonstrated how
much he must have suffered if he had been cut off from Thessaly,
since he found it unsafe to go to any great distance from
it. Perseus, having drawn all his forces into one body, and
assembled all his generals, reprimanded severely the commanders
of the garrisons, and particularly Hippias, and Asclepiodotus;
asserting that they had betrayed to the Romans
the keys of Macedonia; of which charge no one was more
truly guilty than himself. The consul, on seeing the fleet at
sea, conceived hopes that they were coming with provisions,
for every article had now become very dear and very scarce;
but when the ships came into harbour, he was informed that
the transports had been left behind at Magnesia. He was
then under great perplexity to determine what measures to
take; so hard did he find it to struggle with the difficulties of
his situation, though not aggravated by any effort of the enemy;
when, very seasonably, a letter arrived from Lucretius, acquainting
him that he was in possession of all the forts about
Tempe and Phila, and had found in them great plenty of corn
and other necessaries.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h8" name="h8"></a>8</span>
The consul, highly delighted with this intelligence,
removed his quarters from Dium to Phila, in order to strengthen
that post, and, at the same time, to distribute corn to the soldiers,
on the spot, as the carriage of it thence would be tedious.
That march gave rise to opinions not at all favourable to his
reputation: some said that he retired from the enemy through
fear; because if he had staid in Pieria he must have risked a
battle: others, that, not considering the daily changes produced
by fortune in the affairs of war, he had let slip out of
his hands advantages which threw themselves in his way, and
which, in all probability, he could never regain. For, by
giving up the possession of Dium, he at once roused the enemy
to action; who at length saw the necessity of endeavouring to
recover what he had lost before, through his own fault. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2066" id="Page_2066">Pg 2066</a></span>
hearing of the consul&#8217;s departure, therefore, Perseus marched
back to Dium, repaired whatever had been destroyed and laid
waste by the Romans, rebuilt the battlements which they had
thrown down, strengthened the fortifications all round, and
then pitched his camp within five miles of the city, on the
hither bank of the Enipeus, in order to have the river itself, the
passage of which was extremely difficult, as a defence to his
post. The Enipeus, which rises in a valley of Mount Olympus,
is a small stream during the summer, but is raised by the
winter rains to a violent torrent, when, as it runs over the
rocks, it forms furious eddies, and, by sweeping away the
earth at the bottom into the sea, makes very deep gulfs, while
the sinking of the middle of the channel renders the banks
both high and steep. Perseus, thinking that the advance of
the enemy was sufficiently obstructed by this river, contemplated
spending there the remainder of the summer. In the
mean time, the consul sent Popilius, with two thousand men,
from Phila to Heracleum. It is distant about five miles from
Phila, midway between Dium and Tempe, and stands on a
steep rock hanging over the river.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h9" name="h9"></a>9</span>
Popilius, before he brought his troops up to the walls,
sent to recommend to the magistrates and principal men, rather
to try the honour and clemency of the Romans than their
power; but this advice produced no effect, the fires in the
king&#8217;s camp on the Enipeus being now within their sight.
The attack was then commenced by assaults, and with works
and machines, as well on the side facing the sea, (for the ships
had been brought up close to the shore,) as on land. A party
of Roman youths actually gained possession of the lowest part
of the wall, by turning to the purposes of war a kind of sport
which they were accustomed to practise in the circus. In
those times, when the present extravagant fashion of filling
the area with beasts of every kind was yet unknown, it was
customary to contrive various kinds of amusements; for when
one chariot race and one equestrian performer were exhibited,
both the performances scarcely filled up the space of an hour.
Among other diversions, in the more elaborate games, about
sixty young men in arms, sometimes more, used to be introduced,
whose performances were partly a representation of
troops going through the military exercise, and partly a display
of more accurate skill than appeared in the practice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2067" id="Page_2067">Pg 2067</a></span>
soldiers, and which approached nearer to the mode of fighting
used by gladiators. After performing various evolutions, they
formed in a square body with their shields raised over their
heads, and closed together, the foremost standing upright, the
next stooping a little, the third and fourth lines more and
more, and so on, until the hindmost rested on their knees,
thus composing a covering in the shape of a tortoise-shell,
and sloping, like the roof of a house. Then two armed men,
who stood at the distance of about fifty feet, ran forward, and
after some menacing flourishes of their arms, mounted over
the closed shields, from the bottom to the top of this roof;
and, treading as steadily as if on solid ground, sometimes paraded
along the extreme edges of it, as if repelling an enemy,
and sometimes encountered each other on the middle of it.
A body similar to this was brought up against the lowest
part of the wall, and the soldiers, standing thereon, mounted
until they were as high as the defendants on the battlements;
and these having been beaten off, the soldiers of two companies
climbed over into the town. The only difference was, that here
the outside men in the front and in the two flanks alone did
not raise their shields over their heads, lest they should expose
their bodies, but held them before them, as in battle; so that
the weapons thrown at them from the walls, as they advanced,
did them no injury, while those that were poured like a shower
on the roof glided down the smooth slope to the bottom, without
doing any mischief. When Heracleum was taken, the
consul removed his quarters thither, as if he intended to besiege
Dium; and, after driving the king thence, to advance to
Pieria. But as he was now preparing his quarters for the
winter, he ordered roads to be made for the conveyance of
provisions from Thessaly, and proper places to be chosen for
store-houses; also huts to be built, where the people employed
in bringing the provisions might lodge.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h10" name="h10"></a>10</span>
Perseus, having at length recovered his spirits, after the
panic with which he had been seized, began to wish that
obedience had not been paid to the orders which he had given
in his fright, to throw the treasures at Pella into the sea, and
to burn the naval arsenals at Thessalonica. Andronicus,
indeed, whom he had sent to Thessalonica, had spun out
the time, leaving him time for repentance, which actually
took place; but Nicias, less provident, threw into the sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2068" id="Page_2068">Pg 2068</a></span>
what money he found at Pella. He seems, however, to
have fallen into a mistake which was not without remedy,
inasmuch as the greatest part of that treasure was brought
up again by divers. Nevertheless, such shame did the king
feel for his terror on the occasion, that he caused the
divers to be privately put to death, together with Andronicus
and Nicias, that there might be no living witnesses of so preposterous
an order. In the mean time, Caius Marcius, with
the fleet, sailed from Heracleum to Thessalonica. Landing his
men, he made wide depredations on the country; and when
the troops from the city came out against him, he defeated
them in several actions, and drove them back in dismay within
their walls. He even alarmed the city itself; but the townsmen,
erecting engines of every kind, wounded, with stones
thrown from them, not only such as straggled carelessly near
the walls, but even those who were on board the ships. He
therefore re-embarked his troops; and giving up the design
of besieging Thessalonica, proceeded thence to &AElig;nia, fifteen
miles distant, situated opposite to Pydna, in a fertile country.
After ravaging the lands in that quarter, he coasted along the
shore until he arrived at Antigonea. Here his troops landed,
and for some time carried their depredations through all the
country round, putting a great deal of booty on board the
ships; but afterwards a party of Macedonians, consisting of
foot and horse intermixed, fell upon them as they straggled,
and, pursuing them as they fled to the shore, killed near five
hundred, and took as many prisoners. Extreme necessity, on
finding themselves hindered from safely regaining their vessels,
roused the courage of the Roman soldiers, at once with
despair of any other means of safety, (than by resistance,) and
also with indignation. They renewed the fight on the shore,
and those who were on board assisted them; and here about
two hundred Macedonians were killed, and a like number
taken. From Antigonea the fleet sailed on to the district of
Pallene, where a descent was made for the purpose of plundering.
This district belonged to the territory of Cassandrea,
and was by far the most plentiful of any at which they had
yet touched on the coast. There they were met by king Eumenes,
who came from Elea with twenty decked ships; and
king Prusias also sent thither five ships of war.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h11" name="h11"></a>11</span>
By this accession of strength the pr&aelig;tor was encouraged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2069" id="Page_2069">Pg 2069</a></span>
to lay siege to Cassandrea. This city was built by king Cassander,
in the pass which connects the territory of Pallene
with the rest of Macedonia. It is bounded on one side by the
Toron&aelig;an, on another by the Macedonian Sea; for it stands
on a neck of land which stretches into the ocean, and rises in
the part opposite Magnesia to a height equal to that of Mount
Athos, forming two unequal promontories, the larger called
Posideum, the smaller Canastr&aelig;um. The besiegers formed
their attacks on two different sides; the Roman general, at a
place called Clit&aelig;, drew a trench from the Macedonian to the
Toron&aelig;an Sea, to which he added pointed palisades, to cut
off the communication; while on the other side is the Euripus,
where Eumenes carried on his attack. The Romans underwent
a vast deal of labour in filling up a trench, which
Perseus had recently dug in the way; and on the pr&aelig;tor inquiring
where the earth that had been taken out of it was
thrown, as he saw no heaps of it any where, some arches were
shown him that were closed up with it, not of equal thickness
with the old wall, but with a single row of brick. On this,
he formed the design of opening a way into the city, by breaking
through that wall; and he hoped to be able to escape observation,
if, by assaulting another part by scalade, and raising
a tumult there, he could divert the attention of the besieged
to the defence of the place attacked. There were in garrison
at Cassandrea, besides the younger inhabitants, who formed
no contemptible body, eight hundred Agrians and two thousand
Illyrians from Penestia, sent thither by Pleuratus, each
being a warlike race. While these were busy in defending
the walls, and the Romans using their utmost efforts to scale
them, in an instant of time the arches were broken through,
and the city laid open; and if those who made this irruption
had been armed, they must have immediately become masters
of the town. When the soldiers were told that this work was
accomplished, they were so elated with joy, that they raised a
sudden shout, expecting to force their way in, some in one
part, and others in another.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h12" name="h12"></a>12</span>
At first the enemy was seized with wonder at to what
this sudden shout could mean; but when Pytho and Philip,
the commanders of the garrison, were told that the city was
laid open, they concluded that every advantage resulting from
that event would be in favour of whichever party should make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2070" id="Page_2070">Pg 2070</a></span>
the first charge; and, therefore, they sallied out, with a strong
body of Agrians and Illyrians, who, while the Romans were
coming together and being congregated from various parts
that they might march in order into the city, routed them
while thus disordered and irregular, and drove them to the
trench, into which they tumbled them, in heaps, one over another.
About six hundred were killed in this action, and almost
every one that was found between the wall and the
trench was wounded. The blow meditated by the pr&aelig;tor
having thus recoiled on himself, made him slower to form any
other attempts; and as Eumenes made little or no progress
though he carried on his operations both by land and sea, they
concurred in a resolution to strengthen their guards, in order
to prevent the introduction of any reinforcement from Macedonia:
and, since they had not succeeded by assault, to carry
on the siege by regular approaches. While they were making
preparations for this, ten barks, belonging to the king, sent
from Thessalonica, with a chosen body of Gallic auxiliaries,
observing the enemy&#8217;s ships lying at anchor in the road, and
keeping as close to the shore as possible, amidst the darkness
of the night, in a single line, effected their entrance to the city.
Intelligence of this new addition of force obliged both the Romans
and Eumenes to raise the siege. They then sailed round
the promontory, and brought the fleet into the harbour of Torone.
This town also they attempted to besiege; but, perceiving
that it was defended, by a strong garrison, they dropped
the design, and proceeded to Demetrias. When they approached
this place, they saw the walls fully manned with
armed troops; they therefore sailed on, and brought the fleet
into harbour at Iolcos, intending, after ravaging the country
there, to proceed to the siege of Demetrias.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h13" name="h13"></a>13</span>
In the mean time, the consul, not to lie inactive in the
enemies&#8217; country, sent Marcus Popilius, with five thousand
men, to reduce the city of Melib&#339;a. This city stands at the
foot of the Mount Ossa, where it stretches out into Thessaly,
and is very advantageously situated for commanding Demetrias.
The first approach of the enemy struck terror into the
inhabitants of the place; but soon recovering from the fright
occasioned by the unexpectedness of the event, they ran
hastily in arms to the gates and walls, where an entrance was
apprehended, and at once put a stop to all hope of taking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2071" id="Page_2071">Pg 2071</a></span>
place by the first assault. Preparations were therefore
made for a siege, and the works commenced for making the
approaches. When Perseus was informed that both Melib&#339;a
was being besieged by the consul&#8217;s army, and that the fleet at
the same time was lying at Iolcos, intending to proceed thence
to attack Demetrias, he sent Euphranor, one of his generals,
with two thousand chosen men, to Melib&#339;a. His orders were,
that, if he could compel the Romans to retire from before Melib&#339;a,
he should then march secretly into Demetrias, before
the enemy should bring up their troops from Iolcos to that city.
As soon as he suddenly became visible on the high grounds
to the besiegers of Melib&#339;a, they abandoned their numerous
works in great consternation, and set them on fire. Thus they
withdrew from Melib&#339;a, and Euphranor, having raised the
siege of one city, marched instantly to Demetrias. Then the
townsmen felt confident that they should be able, not only to
defend their walls, but to protect their lands also from depredations;
and they made several irruptions on the straggling
parties of the plunderers, not without injury to the enemy.
However, the pr&aelig;tor and the king rode round the walls to
view the situation of the city, and try whether they might attempt
it on any side, either by storm or works. It was reported,
that some overtures of friendship between Eumenes
and Perseus were here agitated, through Cydas, a Cretan, and
Antimachus, governor of Demetrias. It is certain, that the
armies retired from Demetrias. Eumenes sailed to the consul;
and, after congratulating him on his success in penetrating
into Macedonia, went home to Pergamus. Marcius Figulus,
the pr&aelig;tor, having sent part of his fleet to winter at Sciathus,
with the remainder repaired to Oreum in Eub&#339;a; judging
that the most convenient city from which he could send supplies
to the armies in Macedonia and Thessaly. There are
very different accounts given respecting king Eumenes: if Valerius
Antias is to be believed, he neither gave any assistance
with his fleet to the pr&aelig;tor, though often solicited by letters;
nor did he depart from the consul for Asia in good humour,
being offended at not being permitted to lie in the same camp
with him; he says too, that he could not be prevailed on even to
leave the Gallic horsemen that he had brought with him. But
his brother Attalus remained with the consul, and in the constant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2072" id="Page_2072">Pg 2072</a></span>
tenor of his conduct evinced a sincere attachment, and
an extraordinary degree of zeal and activity in the service.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h14" name="h14"></a>14</span>
While the war was being carried on in Macedonia, ambassadors
came to Rome, from a chieftain of the Gauls beyond
the Alps, whose name is said to have been Balanos, but of
what tribe is not mentioned. They brought an offer of assistance
towards the war in Macedonia. The senate returned him
thanks, and sent him presents,&mdash;a golden chain of two pounds
weight, golden bowls to the amount of four pounds, a horse
completely caparisoned, and a suit of horseman&#8217;s armour.
After the Gauls, ambassadors from Pamphylia, brought into
the senate-house a golden crown, of the value of twenty thousand
Philippeans, and requested permission to deposit it, as
an offering, in the shrine of Jupiter supremely good and great,
and to offer sacrifice in the Capitol, which was granted. The
said ambassadors having expressed a wish to renew the treaty
of friendship, a gracious answer was given, and a present was
made to each of two thousand <i>asses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Then audience was
given to the ambassadors of king Prusias; and, a little after,
to those of the Rhodians, who discoursed on the same subject,
but in a widely different manner. The purpose of both embassies
was, to effect a peace with king Perseus. The address
of Prusias consisted of entreaties rather than demands; for
he declared, that &#8220;he had hitherto supported the cause of the
Romans, and would continue to support it as long as the war
should continue. But, on Perseus sending ambassadors to
him, on the subject of putting an end to the war with Rome,
he had promised them to become a mediator with the senate:&#8221;
and he requested that, &#8220;if they could prevail on themselves to
lay aside their resentment, they would place him in the favourable
position of mediator of the peace.&#8221; Such was the discourse
of the king&#8217;s ambassadors. The Rhodians, after ostentatiously
recounting their many services to the Roman people,
and arrogating to themselves rather the greater share of its
successes, particularly in the case of king Antiochus, proceeded
in this manner; that, &#8220;at a time when peace subsisted
between the Macedonians and Romans, they likewise commenced
a friendship with king Perseus, which they had,
since, unwillingly broken, without having any reason to complain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2073" id="Page_2073">Pg 2073</a></span>
of him, but merely because it was the desire of the
Romans to draw them into a confederacy in the war, that for
three years past they had felt many inconveniences from that
war. In consequence of the interruption of commerce, and
the loss of their port duties and provisions, their island was
distressed by a general scarcity. When their countrymen
could no longer suffer this, they had sent other ambassadors
into Macedonia, to Perseus, to announce to him that it was
the wish of the Rhodians that he should conclude a peace with
the Romans, and had sent them to Rome with the same
message. The Rhodians would afterwards consider what
measures they should judge proper to be taken against either
party that should prevent an end being put to the war.&#8221; I am
convinced that no person, even at the present time, can hear
or read such expressions without indignation; we may, then,
easily judge what was the state of mind of the senators when
they listened to them.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h15" name="h15"></a>15</span>
According to the account of Claudius, no answer was
given; and a decree of the senate only was read, by which
the Roman people ordered, that the Carians and Lycians
should enjoy independence; and that a letter should be
sent immediately to each of those nations, acquainting them
therewith. On hearing which the principal ambassador,
whose arrogant demeanour, just before, the senate could
scarce contain, fell down insensible. Other writers say, that an
answer was given to this effect: &#8220;That, at the commencement
of the present war, the Roman people had learned, from
unquestionable authority, that the Rhodians, in concert with
king Perseus, had formed secret machinations against their
commonwealth; and that, if that matter had been doubtful
hitherto, the words of their ambassadors, just now, had reduced
it to a certainty; as, in general, treachery, though at
first sufficiently cautious, yet, in the end, betrays itself. Were
the Rhodians now to act the part of arbiters of war and peace
throughout the world? were the Romans at their nod to take
up arms and lay them down? and henceforth to appeal, not to
the gods, but to the Rhodians, for their sanction of treaties?
And was this indeed the case, that, unless their orders were
obeyed, and the armies withdrawn from Macedonia, they would
consider what measures they should take? What the Rhodians
might determine, they themselves knew best; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2074" id="Page_2074">Pg 2074</a></span>
Roman people, as soon as the conquest of Perseus should be
completed, an event which they hoped was at no great distance,
would most certainly consider how to make due retribution
to each state, according to its deserts in the course of the
war.&#8221; Nevertheless the usual presents of two thousand <i>asses</i>
each were sent to the ambassadors, which they did not accept.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h16" name="h16"></a>16</span>
Then was read a letter from the consul, Quintus
Marcius, informing the senate, that &#8220;he had passed the
mountains, and penetrated into Macedonia; that the pr&aelig;tor
had collected there, and procured from other places, stores of
provisions for the approaching winter; and that he had
brought from the Epirots twenty thousand measures of
wheat, ten thousand of barley, the price of which he desired
might be paid to their ambassadors in Rome: that clothing
for the troops must be sent from Rome; and that he wanted
about two hundred horses, above all Numidian horses; where
he was, he could procure none.&#8221; The senate decreed, that
every thing should be done in accordance with the consul&#8217;s
letter. The pr&aelig;tor, Caius Sulpicius, agreed with contractors
for conveying into Macedonia six thousand gowns, thirty thousand
tunics, and the horses, all to be left to the approbation of
the consul; and he paid the Epirot ambassadors the price of
the corn. He then introduced to the senate, Onesimus, son
of Pytho, a Macedonian of distinction. He had always advised
the king to peaceable measures, and recommended to
him, that, as his father Philip had, to the last day of his life,
made it an established rule to read over twice every day the
treaty concluded with the Romans, so he should, if not daily,
yet frequently, observe the same practice. When he could not
dissuade him from war, he at first began to absent himself on
various pretences, that he might not be present at proceedings
which he could not approve. But at last, having discovered
that suspicions were harboured against him, and that he was
tacitly accused of the crime of treason, he went over to the
Romans, and was of great service to the consul. When he
was introduced into the senate-house, he mentioned these circumstances,
and the senate thereupon decreed that he should
be enrolled in the number of their allies; that a house and
accommodations should be provided for him; also a grant of
two hundred acres of land, in that part of the Tarentine territory
which was the public property of the Roman people;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2075" id="Page_2075">Pg 2075</a></span>
and a house in Tarentum to be bought for him; the charge
of executing all which was committed to Caius Decimius, the
pr&aelig;tor. On the ides of December, the censors performed the
general survey with more severity than formerly. A great
many were deprived of their horses, among whom was Publius
Rutilius, who, when tribune of the people, had carried on a
violent prosecution against them; he was, besides, degraded
from his tribe, and disfranchised. In pursuance of a decree
of the senate, one-half of the taxes of that year was paid by
the qu&aelig;stors into the hands of the censors, to defray the
expenses of public works. Tiberius Sempronius, out of the
money assigned to him, purchased for the public the house of
Publius Africanus, behind the old house, near the statue of
Vertumnus, with the butchers&#8217; stalls and shops adjoining;
where he built the public court-house, afterwards called the
Sempronian.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h17" name="h17"></a>17</span>
The end of the year was now approaching, and people
chiefly canvassed in their conversation, through their concern
about the war in Macedonia, what consuls they should choose,
to bring that war, at length, to a conclusion. The senate therefore
passed an order, that Cneius Servilius should come home,
at the very first opportunity, to hold the elections. Sulpicius,
the pr&aelig;tor, sent the order of the senate to the consul; and, in
a few days after, read his answer in public, wherein he promised
to be in the city before the * * day of * * *. The consul
came in due time, and the election was finished on the day
appointed. The consuls chosen were, Lucius &AElig;milius Paullus,
a second time, fourteen years after his first consulship,
and Caius Licinius Crassus. Next day, the following were
appointed pr&aelig;tors: Cneius B&aelig;bius Tamphilus, Lucius Anicius
Gallus, Cneius Octavius, Publius Fonteius Balbus, Marcus
&AElig;butius Elva, and Caius Papirius Corbo. The senate&#8217;s
anxiety about the Macedonian war stimulated them to more
than ordinary expedition in all their proceedings; they therefore
ordered, that the magistrates elect should immediately cast
lots for their provinces, that it might be known which consul
was to have the command in Macedonia, and which pr&aelig;tor
that of the fleet; in order that they might, without loss of
time, consider and prepare whatever was requisite for the
service, and consult the senate on any point where their direction
was necessary, they voted, that, &#8220;on the magistrates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2076" id="Page_2076">Pg 2076</a></span>
coming into office, the Latin festival should be celebrated as
early as the rules of religion permitted; and that the consul
who was to go into Macedonia should not be detained on account
of it.&#8221; When these orders were passed, Italy and
Macedonia were named as the provinces for the consuls; and
for the pr&aelig;tors, besides the two jurisdictions in the city, the
fleet, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia. As to the consuls, Macedonia
fell to &AElig;milius, Italy to Licinius. Of the pr&aelig;tors,
Cneius B&aelig;bius got the city jurisdiction; Lucius Anicius the
foreign, under a rule to go wherever the senate should direct;
Cneius Octavius, the fleet; Publius Fonteius, Spain; Marcus
&AElig;butius, Sicily; and Caius Papirius, Sardinia.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h18" name="h18"></a>18</span>
It immediately became evident to all, that Lucius
&AElig;milius would prosecute the war with vigour; for, besides
that he was a different kind of man (from his predecessors),
his thoughts were intently employed night and day solely on
the business relative to that war. In the first place, he requested
the senate to send commissioners into Macedonia, to
review the armies and the fleet, and to bring authentic information
as to what might be necessary both for the land and
sea forces; to make what discoveries they could respecting
the state of the king&#8217;s forces; and to learn how much of the
country was in our power, how much in that of the enemy;
whether the Romans were still encamped among the woods and
mountains, or had got clear of all the difficult passes, and were
come down into the plains; who appeared to be faithful allies
to us, who were doubtful and suspended their fidelity on fortune,
and who avowed enemies; what store of provisions was
prepared, and whence new supplies might be brought by land-carriage,
whence by the fleet; and what had been achieved
during the last campaign, either on land or sea. For he
thought that, by gaining a thorough knowledge of all these
particulars, decisive plans might be taken for future proceedings.
The senate directed the consul Cneius Servilius to send
as commissioners, into Macedonia, such persons as should be
approved of by Luciua &AElig;milius. Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus,
Aulus Licinius Nerva, and Lucius B&aelig;bius, accordingly,
began their journey two days after. Towards the close
of this year it was reported that two showers of stones had
fallen, one in the territory of Rome, the other in that of Veii;
and the nine days&#8217; solemnity was performed. Of the priests,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2077" id="Page_2077">Pg 2077</a></span>
died this year, Publius Quintilius Varus, flamen of Mars, and
Marcus Claudius Marcellus, decemvir, in whose room was
substituted Cneius Octavius. It has been remarked as an
instance of the increasing munificence of the times, that in
the Circensian games, exhibited by Publius Cornelius Scipio
Nasica and Publius Lentulus, curule &aelig;diles, sixty-three panthers,
with forty bears and elephants, made a part of the show.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h19" name="h19"></a>19</span>
At the beginning of the following year, Lucius &AElig;milius
Paullus and Caius Licinius, the consuls, having commenced
their administration on the ides of March, the senators
were impatient to hear what propositions were to be laid
before them, particularly with respect to Macedonia, by
the consul to whose lot that province had fallen; but Paullus
said, that he had as yet nothing to propose to them, the
commissioners not being returned: that &#8220;they were then at
Brundusium, after having been twice driven back to Dyrrachium
in attempting the passage: that he intended, shortly, to
propose something to their consideration, when he should
have obtained the information which was previously necessary,
and which he expected within very few days.&#8221; He added,
that, &#8220;in order that nothing should delay his setting out, the
day before the ides of April had been fixed for the Latin
festival; after finishing which solemnity, he and Cneius Octavius
would begin their journey as soon as the senate should
direct: that, in his absence, his colleague Caius Licinius would
take care that every thing necessary to be provided, or sent
for the war, should be provided and sent; and that, in the
mean time, audience might be given to the embassies of foreign
nations.&#8221; The first introduced were ambassadors from Alexandria,
sent by king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra. They
came into the senate-house dressed in mourning, with their
hair and beard neglected, holding in their hands branches of
olive; there they prostrated themselves, and their discourse
was even more piteous than their dress. Antiochus, king of
Syria, who had formerly been a hostage at Rome, had lately,
under the honourable pretext of restoring the elder Ptolemy
to the throne, made war on his younger brother, who was
then in possession of Alexandria; and having gained the victory
in a sea-fight off Pelusium, and thrown a temporary
bridge across the Nile, he led over his army, and was terrifying
Alexandria itself, by laying siege to it; so that he seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2078" id="Page_2078">Pg 2078</a></span>
almost on the point of taking possession of that very opulent
kingdom. The ambassadors, after complaining of these proceedings,
besought the senate to succour those princes, the
faithful friends of their empire. They said, that &#8220;such had
been the kindness of the Roman people to Antiochus, such its
influence over all kings and nations, that if they only sent ambassadors,
to give him notice that the senate were displeased
at war being made with princes in alliance with them, he
would instantly retire from the walls of Alexandria, and lead
his army home into Syria. But if they hesitated to do this
Ptolemy and Cleopatra would soon come to Rome as exiles
from their kingdom, which must excite some degree of shame
in the Roman people, for not having brought them assistance
in their extreme distress.&#8221; The senate, affected by the supplications
of the Alexandrians, immediately sent Caius Popilius
L&aelig;nas, Caius Decimius, and Caius Hostilius, ambassadors, to
put an end to the dispute between those kings. Their instructions
were, to go first to Antiochus, then to Ptolemy;
and to acquaint them, that, unless hostilities were stopped,
whichever party persisted, must expect to be considered by
the senate as neither a friend nor an ally.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h20" name="h20"></a>20</span>
These ambassadors set out, within three days, in company
with those of Alexandria; and, on the last day of the feast of
Minerva, the commissioners arrived from Macedonia. Their
coming had been so impatiently wished for, that, if it had not
been very late in the day, the consuls would have assembled
the senate immediately. Next day the senate met, and the
commissioners had an audience. They stated, that &#8220;the army
had been led through pathless and difficult wilds into Macedonia,
with more risk than advantage: that Pieria, to which
its march had been directed, was then possessed by the king;
and the two camps so close to each other, as to be separated
only by the river Enipeus: that the king offered no opportunity
to fight, nor were our men strong enough to compel him;
and, besides, that the winter had unexpectedly interrupted all
military operations: that the soldiers were maintained in
idleness, and had not corn sufficient for more than six <i>days</i>:
that the force of the Macedonians was said to amount to
thirty thousand effective men: that if Appius Claudius had
a sufficient force at Lychnidus, the king might be perplexed
by a twofold hostile array; but that, as the case stood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2079" id="Page_2079">Pg 2079</a></span>
both Appius, and the troops under his command, were in the
utmost danger, unless either a regular army were speedily sent
thither, or they were removed thence. &#8220;From the camp,&#8221;
they stated that &#8220;they had gone to the fleet; where they
learned, that part of the seamen had perished by sickness;
that others, particularly such as came from Sicily, had gone
off to their own homes; and that the ships were in want of
men, while those who were on board had neither received pay
nor had clothing: that Eumenes and his fleet, as if driven
thither by the wind, had both come and gone away, without
any apparent reason; nor did the intentions of that king seem
to be thoroughly settled.&#8221; While they reported every particular
in the conduct of Eumenes as suspicious, they represented
the fidelity of Attalus as stedfast in the highest degree.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h21" name="h21"></a>21</span>
After the commissioners were heard, Lucius &AElig;milius
said, that he then proposed for consideration the business of
the war: and the senate decreed, that &#8220;tribunes for eight
legions should be appointed, half by the consuls, and half by
the people; but that none should be named for that year who
had not held some magisterial office: that, out of all the
military tribunes, Lucius &AElig;milius should select such as he
chose for the two legions that were to serve in Macedonia;
and that, as soon as the Latin festival should be finished, the
said consul, with the pr&aelig;tor Cneius Octavius, to whose lot the
fleet had fallen, should repair to that province.&#8221; To these
was added a third, Lucius Anicius, the pr&aelig;tor who had the
foreign jurisdiction; for it was resolved that he should succeed
Appius Claudius in the province of Illyria, near Lychnidus.
The charge of raising recruits was laid on the consul
Caius Licinius, who was ordered to enlist, of Roman citizens,
seven thousand foot and two hundred horse, and to demand,
from the Latin confederates, seven thousand foot and four
hundred horse; and also to write to Cneius Servilius, governor
of Gaul, to raise there six hundred horse. This force he was
ordered to send, with all expedition, into Macedonia, to his
colleague. It was resolved, that there should be no more
than two legions in that province, but that their numbers
should be filled up so as that each should contain six thousand
foot and three hundred horse; and that the rest of the foot
and horse should be placed in the different garrisons; that
such men as were unfit for service should be discharged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2080" id="Page_2080">Pg 2080</a></span>
that the allies should be obliged to raise another body of ten
thousand foot and eight hundred horse. These were assigned
as a reinforcement to Anicius, in addition to the two legions
which he was ordered to carry into Illyria, consisting each of
five thousand two hundred foot and three hundred horse;
and five thousand seamen were raised for the fleet. The
consul Licinius was ordered to employ two legions in the
service of his province, and to add to them ten thousand foot
and six hundred horse of the allies.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h22" name="h22"></a>22</span>
When the senate had passed these decrees, the consul
Lucius &AElig;milius went out from the senate-house into the assembly
of the people, whom he addressed in a discourse to this
effect: &#8220;Romans, I think I have perceived that your congratulations,
on my obtaining, by lot, the province of Macedonia,
were warmer than either when I was saluted consul, or
on the day when I entered on office; and that for no other
reason, than your having conceived an opinion, that by me the
war with Perseus, which has been long protracted, may be
brought to a conclusion becoming the majesty of the Roman
people. I trust that the gods also have favoured this disposal
of the lots, and will give me their aid in the conduct of affairs.
Some of these consequences I can prognosticate; others I can
hope for. One thing I regard as certain, and venture to
affirm; that I will endeavour, by every exertion in my power,
that this hope which you have conceived of me may not be
frustrated. Every thing necessary for the service, the senate
has ordered; and as it has been resolved, that I am to go
abroad immediately, and I do not wish to delay, my colleague,
Caius Licinius, an admirable man, will make the preparations
with as much zeal, as if he himself were to carry on that
war. Do you give full credit to whatever I shall write to
you, or to the senate; but do not by your credulity encourage
mere rumours, of which no man shall appear as the responsible
author. For, no man is so entirely regardless of reputation,
as that his spirits cannot be damped; which I have
observed has commonly occurred, especially in this war. In
every circle, and, truly, at every table, there are people who
lead armies into Macedonia; who know where the camp
ought to be placed; what posts ought to be occupied by
troops; when and through what pass Macedonia should be
entered; where magazines should be formed; how provisions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2081" id="Page_2081">Pg 2081</a></span>
should be conveyed by land and sea; and when it is proper to
engage the enemy, when to lie quiet. And they not only determine
what is best to be done, but if any thing is done in any
other manner than what they have pointed out, they arraign
the consul, as if he were on his trial. These are great impediments
to those who have the management of affairs; for
every one cannot encounter injurious reports with the same
constancy and firmness of mind as Fabius did, who chose to
let his own authority be diminished through the folly of
the people, rather than to mismanage the public business with
a high reputation. I am not one of those who think that
commanders ought never to receive advice; on the contrary,
I should deem that man more proud than wise, who did every
thing of his own single judgment. What then is my opinion?
That commanders should be counselled, chiefly, by persons of
known talent; by those, especially, who are skilled in the art
of war, and who have been taught by experience; and next,
by those who are present at the scene of action, who see the
country, who see the enemy; who see the advantages that
occasions offer, and who, embarked, as it were, in the same
ship, are sharers of the danger. If, therefore, any one thinks
himself qualified to give advice respecting the war which I
am to conduct, which may prove advantageous to the public,
let him not refuse his assistance to the state, but let him come
with me into Macedonia. He shall be furnished by me with a
ship, a horse, a tent; and even with his travelling charges. But
if he thinks this too much trouble, and prefers the repose of a
city life to the toils of war, let him not, on land, assume the
office of a pilot. The city, in itself, furnishes abundance of
topics for conversation; let it confine its passion for talking,
and rest assured, that we shall be content with such councils
as shall be framed within our camp.&#8221; Soon after this speech,
the Latin festival having been celebrated on the day before
the calends of April, and the sacrifice on the mount affording
favourable omens, the consul, and Cneius Octavius, the pr&aelig;tor,
set out directly for Macedonia. There is a tradition
that the consul, at his departure, was escorted by multitudes
unusually numerous; and that people, with confident hope,
presaged a conclusion of the Macedonian war, and the speedy
return of the consul, to a glorious triumph.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h23" name="h23"></a>23</span>
During these occurrences in Italy, Perseus, though he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2082" id="Page_2082">Pg 2082</a></span>
could not, at first, prevail on himself to complete the design
which he had projected, of attaching to himself Gentius,
king of Illyria, on account of the money which would be demanded
for it; yet, when he found that the Romans had
penetrated the passes, and that the final crisis of the war
drew near, resolved to defer it no longer, and having, by his
ambassador Hippias, consented to pay three thousand talents
of silver,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> provided hostages were given on both sides; he
now sent Pantauchus, one of his most trusty friends, to conclude
the business. Pantauchus met the Illyrian king at Meteo,
in the province of Labeas, and there received from the
king his oath and the hostages. Gentius likewise sent an
ambassador, named Olympio, to require an oath and hostages
from Perseus. Together with him, were sent persons to receive
the money; and by the advice of Pantauchus, to go to Rhodes
with ambassadors from Macedonia. Parmenio and Morcus
were appointed. Their instructions were, first, to receive
the king&#8217;s oath, the hostages, and money; and then to proceed
to Rhodes; and it was hoped, that, by the name of the two
kings, the Rhodians might be incited to a war against Rome,
and that the union of that state, which alone at that time
possessed naval glory, would leave the Romans no prospect
of success, either on land or sea. As the Illyrians approached,
Perseus marched with all his cavalry, from his camp on the
Enipeus, and met them at Dium. There the articles agreed on
were executed; a body of cavalry having been drawn up
around, whom the king chose should be witness to the treaty
of alliance made with Gentius, supposing that this event would
add greatly to their confidence. The hostages were given
and taken in the sight of all; those who were to receive the
money were sent to Pella, where the king&#8217;s treasure lay; and
the persons who were to go to Rhodes, with the Illyrian
ambassadors, were ordered to take ship at Thessalonica.
There was present one Metrodorus, who had lately come from
Rhodes, and who, on the authority of Dinon and Polyaratus,
two principal members of that state, affirmed, that the Rhodians
were prepared for the war; he was appointed head of
the joint embassy with the Illyrians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h24" name="h24"></a>24</span>
At this time Perseus sent to Eumenes and Antiochus,
a common message, which the state of affairs seemed to suggest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2083" id="Page_2083">Pg 2083</a></span>that &#8220;a free state, and a king, were, in their natures, hostile
to each other. That the Roman people were accustomed to
attack kings singly; and, what was more shameful, to conquer
them, by the power of other kings. Thus, his father was
overpowered by the aid of Attalus; and by the assistance of
Eumenes, and of his father Philip, in part, Antiochus had
been vanquished; and now, both Eumenes and Prusias were
armed against himself. If the regal power should be abolished
in Macedonia, the next, in their way, would be Asia,
which they had already rendered, in part, their own, under the
pretence of liberating the states; and next to that Syria.
Already Prusias was honoured by them, far beyond Eumenes;
and already Antiochus, though victorious, was debarred from
Egypt, the prize of his arms.&#8221; He desired that each of them,
&#8220;considering these matters seriously, should see that he either
compelled the Romans to make peace with him, or, if they
should persist in such an unjust war, he should regard them
as the common enemies of all kings.&#8221; The message to Antiochus
was sent openly; the ambassador to Eumenes went under
the pretence of ransoming prisoners. But some more secret
business was transacted between them, which, in addition to
the jealousy and distrust already conceived by the Romans
against Eumenes, <i>brought on him charges</i> of a heavier nature.
For they considered him as a traitor, and nearly as an enemy,
while the two kings laboured to overreach each other in
schemes of fraud and avarice. There was a Cretan, called Cydas,
an intimate of Eumenes; this man had formerly conferred,
at Amphipolis, with one Chimarus, a countryman of his own,
serving in the army of Perseus; and he, afterwards, had had
one interview with Menecrates, and another with Archidamus,
officers of the king, at Demetrias, close under the wall of
the town. Herophon, too, who was sent on that business, had,
before that, executed two embassies to the same Eumenes.
These furtive conferences and embassies were notorious; but
what the subject of them was, or what agreement had taken
place between the kings, remained a secret.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h25" name="h25"></a>25</span>
Now the truth of the matter was this: Eumenes neither
wished success to Perseus nor intended to make war upon
him; and his ill-will arose not so much from the enmity
which they inherited from their fathers, as from the personal
quarrels which had broken out between themselves. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2084" id="Page_2084">Pg 2084</a></span>
jealousy of the two kings was not so moderate, that Eumenes
could, with patience, have seen Perseus acquiring such vast
power and glory as awaited him, if he conquered the Romans.
Besides which, he saw that Perseus, from the commencement
of the war, by every mean, sought a prospect of peace; and
that every day, as the danger approached nearer, he was contriving
and contemplating no other object. He considered
too, that as the war had been protracted beyond the expectations
of the Romans, their commanders and senate would not
be averse from putting an end to a contest so inconvenient
and difficult. Having discovered this inclination in
both parties, he concluded, that, from the disgust of the
stronger party, and the fears of the weaker, this might take
place spontaneously; and therefore he the more wished, for
the sake of conciliating favour to himself, to make his own
efforts available in the business. He therefore, sometimes,
laboured to stipulate for a consideration for not affording
assistance to the Romans, either on sea or land; at other
times, for bringing about a peace with them. He demanded
for not interfering in the war, one thousand talents;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> for effecting
a peace, one thousand five hundred;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> and for his sincerity
in either case, he professed himself prepared, not only
to make oath, but to give hostages also. Perseus, stimulated
by his fears, showed the greatest readiness in the beginning
of the negotiation, and treated without delay about receiving
the hostages; when it was agreed, that, on their being received,
they should be sent to Crete. But when they came
to the mention of money, there he hesitated; remarking that,
in the case of kings of their high character, a pecuniary consideration
was mean and sordid, both with respect to the
giver, and still more so with respect to the receiver. He preferred
not to decline the payment in the hope of a peace with
Rome, but said that he would pay the money when the business
should be concluded; and that he would lodge it in the mean
time in the temple of Samothrace. As that island was under his
own dominion, Eumenes said, that it was all the same as if the
money were at Pella; and he struggled hard to obtain some
part of it at the present. Thus, having man&#339;uvred with
each other to no purpose, they gained nothing but disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h26" name="h26"></a>26</span>
This was not the only business which Perseus left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2085" id="Page_2085">Pg 2085</a></span>unfinished from motives of avarice, since for a small sum
of money he might have procured, through Eumenes, a
secure peace, well purchased even with half of his kingdom;
while, if defrauded, he might have exposed him to public
view, as an enemy laden with his pelf, and made the Romans
deservedly his enemies. Through this avaricious spirit the
prompt alliance of king Gentius, with the assistance of a
large <i>army</i> of Gauls, who had spread themselves through
Illyria, and offered themselves to him, was lost. There
came ten thousand horsemen, and the same number of footmen,
who themselves kept pace with the horses, and in place
of the riders who had fallen, took on the horses to the fight.
They had stipulated that each horseman should receive in
immediate payment, ten golden Philippics, each footman five,
and their commander one thousand. Perseus went from his
camp on the Enipeus with half of his forces to meet them as
they approached; and issued orders through the towns and
villages near the road, to prepare provisions, so that they
might have plenty of corn, wine, and cattle. He brought with
him some horses, trappings, and cloaks, for presents to the
chiefs; and a small quantity of gold to be divided among a
few; for the multitude, he supposed, might be amused with
hopes. He advanced as far as the city of Almana, and encamped
on the bank of the river Axius, at which time the
army of the Gauls lay near Desudaba, in M&aelig;dica, waiting
for the promised hire. Thither he sent Antigonus, one of his
nobles, with directions, that the said army should remove
their camp to Bylazor, a place in P&aelig;onia, and that their chiefs
should come to him in a body. They were at this time
seventy-five miles distant from the river Axius and the king&#8217;s
camp. Antigonus, in his message, told them what great
plenty of every thing was provided on the road by the king&#8217;s
directions, and what presents of apparel, money, and horses
he intended for them on their arrival. They answered, that
they would judge of those things when they saw them; at
the same time asking him, whether, according to their stipulation
for immediate payment, he had brought with him the
gold which was to be distributed to each footman and horseman?
When to this no direct answer was given, Clondicus,
their prince, said, &#8220;Go back, then, and tell your king, that,
unless they should have received the gold and the hostages,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2086" id="Page_2086">Pg 2086</a></span>
the Gauls would never move one step farther.&#8221; When
this message was brought to the king, he called a council:
and, as it was very plain what advice all the members would
give; he, being a better guardian of his money than of his
kingdom, began to descant on the perfidy and savage behaviour
of the Gauls. &#8220;The disasters,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of many states demonstrated,
that it would be dangerous to admit such a multitude
into Macedonia, lest they might feel such allies more
troublesome than their Roman enemies. Five thousand horsemen
would be enough for them to employ in the war, and
that number they need not be afraid to receive.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h27" name="h27"></a>27</span>
It was sufficiently clear to all that what he feared was the
paying of such a multitude, and nothing else; but as none had
the courage to declare their opinion, when asked, Antigonus
was sent again, with a message, that the king chose to employ
only five thousand horsemen, but that he could not receive the
rest of their number. When the barbarians heard this, they
began to murmur, and show a great deal of anger at being
brought so far from home for no purpose; but Clondicus again
asked him, whether he would pay even the five thousand the hire
agreed on. When he perceived that an evasive answer was given
to this question also, the Gauls, dismissing the insidious envoy
unhurt, which was what he himself had scarcely hoped could
be his fate, returned home to the Danube, after utterly wasting
such lands of Thrace as lay near their road. Now had this
body of troops, while the king lay quiet on the Enipeus, been
led against the Romans through the passes of Perrh&aelig;bia, into
Thessaly, it might not only have stripped that country so
bare, that the Romans could not expect supplies from thence;
but might even have destroyed the cities themselves, while
Perseus, by detaining his enemy at the Enipeus, would have
put it out of their power to succour their allies. The Romans,
indeed, would have been obliged to look out for their
own safety, since they could neither stay where they were,
after losing Thessaly, whence their army drew sustenance,
nor move forward, as the camp of the Macedonians <i>stood in
their way. By this error, Perseus enlivened the hopes of the
Romans</i>, and damped not a little <i>those of the Macedonians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
who had depended much on that project. Through the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2087" id="Page_2087">Pg 2087</a></span>avarice, he alienated from him king Gentius. When he
paid, at Pella, three hundred talents to the persons sent by
Gentius, he allowed them to seal up the money. He then
ordered ten talents to be carried to Pantauchus, and these
he desired should be given immediately to the king. He
ordered his people, who were carrying the rest of the money,
sealed with the seals of the Illyrians, to convey it by short
journeys, and when they should come to the bounds of Macedonia,
to halt there, and wait for a message from him. Gentius,
having received this small portion of the money, and
being incessantly urged by Pantauchus to provoke the Romans
by some hostile act, threw into custody Marcus Perperna and
Lucius Petilius, who happened to come at that time as ambassadors.
Having heard this, Perseus, thinking that the Illyrian
had now laid himself under a necessity of waging war
with the Romans at least, sent to recall those who were
conveying the money, as if for no other object, than that the
greatest possible booty might be reserved for the Romans
on his defeat. Herophon, too, returned from Eumenes,
without any one knowing what had been secretly negotiated
between them. The parties themselves had mentioned publicly
that the business of the prisoners had been concluded,
and Eumenes, for the sake of avoiding suspicion, acquainted
the consul with it.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h28" name="h28"></a>28</span>
Upon the return of Herophon from Eumenes, Perseus,
disappointed in his hope, sent Antenor and Callippus, the commanders
of his fleet, with forty barks, to which were added
five heavy galleys, to Tenedos, that they might protect the
vessels sailing to Macedonia with corn, and scattered among
the Cyclades. This squadron, setting sail from Cassandrea,
steered, first, to the harbour at the foot of Mount Athos, and
crossing over thence, with mild weather, to Tenedos, found
lying in the harbour a number of Rhodian undecked ships,
and their commander Eudamus; these they did not offer to
molest, but, after having spoken them in a friendly manner,
suffered them to pursue their course. Then, learning that,
on the other side of the island, fifty transports of their
own were shut up by a squadron of Eumenes, commanded
by Damius, which lay in the mouth of the harbour, they
sailed round with all haste; and the enemy&#8217;s ships retiring,
through fear, they sent on the transports to Macedonia, ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2088" id="Page_2088">Pg 2088</a></span>
barks having been appointed to accompany them, which
were to return to Tenedos as soon as they had convoyed
them to a place of safety. Accordingly, on the ninth day
after, they rejoined the fleet, then lying at Sigeum. From
thence they sailed over to Subota, an island between Elea
and Athos. The next day after the fleet had reached Subota,
it happened that thirty-five vessels, of the kind called
horse-transports, sent by Eumenes to Attalus, and which had
sailed from Elea, with Gallic horsemen and their horses, were
steering towards Phan&aelig;, a promontory of Chios, from whence
they might cross over to Macedonia, A signal having been
given to Antenor, from a post of observation, that these ships
were passing along the main, he left Subota, and met them between
Cape Erythr&aelig; and Chios, where the strait is narrowest.
The officers of Eumenes believed nothing less probable than
that a Macedonian fleet was cruising in that sea; they imagined
that they were Romans, or that Attalus, or some people sent
home by him from the Roman camp, were on their way to
Pergamus. But when, on their nearer approach, the shape of
the vessels was plainly perceived, and when the briskness of
their rowing, and their prows being directed straight against
themselves, proved that enemies were approaching, a panic
was struck into them; for they had no hope of being able to
make resistance, their ships being of an unwieldy kind, and
the Gauls scarcely able to bear a state of quiet when at sea.
Some, who were nearest to the shore of the continent, swam to
Erythr&aelig;; some, crowding all their sail, ran the ships aground
near Chios; and, leaving their horses behind, made for the city
in disorderly flight. When the barks, however, had landed their
troops nearer to the city, where the access was more convenient,
the Macedonians overtook and put to the sword the
flying Gauls, some on the road, and some who had been shut
out before the gate, for the Chians had shut their gates, not
knowing who they were that fled, or who that pursued.
About eight hundred Gauls were killed, and two hundred
made prisoners. Of the horses, some were lost in the sea, by
the ships being wrecked, and others the Macedonians hamstrung
on the shore. Antenor ordered the same ten barks,
which he had employed before, to carry twenty horses of extraordinary
beauty, with the prisoners, to Thessalonica, and
to return to the fleet as speedily as possible; saying, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2089" id="Page_2089">Pg 2089</a></span>
would wait for them at Phan&aelig;. The fleet staid about three
days off the city, and then proceeded to Phan&aelig;, and the ten
barks having returned sooner than was expected, they set
sail, and crossed the &AElig;gean Sea to Delos.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h29" name="h29"></a>29</span>
While these things were taking place, the Roman ambassadors,
Caius Popilius, Caius Decimius, and Caius Hostinus
having sailed from Chalcis with three quinqueremes,
arrived at Delos, and found there forty Macedonian barks,
and five quinqueremes belonging to king Eumenes. The sacred
character of the temple and the island secured all parties from
injury; so that the Roman and Macedonian seamen, and those
of Eumenes, used to meet promiscuously in the temple, a
truce being imposed by the religious feeling which the place
inspired. Antenor, the commander of Perseus&#8217;s fleet, having
learned, by signals from his watch-posts, that several transport
ships were passing by at sea, went himself in pursuit,
with one half of his barks, (distributing the other half
among the Cyclades,) and sunk or plundered every ship he
met with, except such as were bound for Macedonia. Popilius
and the ships of Eumenes assisted as many as they were
able; but, in the night, the Macedonians sailing out, generally
with two or three vessels, passed unseen. About this
time, ambassadors from Macedonia and Illyria came together
to Rhodes. Their influence was the greater, in consequence
of their squadron cruising freely among the Cyclades, and
over all the &AElig;gean Sea, and likewise on account of the junction
of Perseus and Gentius, and of the report of the Gauls
approaching with a great force both of horse and foot. Dinon
and Polyaratus, the partisans of Perseus, now took fresh
courage, and the Rhodians not only gave a favourable answer
to the ambassadors, but declared publicly, that &#8220;they would
put an end to the war by their own influence; and therefore
desired the kings to dispose themselves to accede to a peace.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h30" name="h30"></a>30</span>
It was now the beginning of spring, and the new commanders
had arrived in their provinces; the consul &AElig;milius
in Macedonia, Octavius at Oreum, where the fleet lay, and
Anicius in Illyria, to carry on the war against Gentius. This
prince, who was the son of Pleuratus, king of Illyria, and his
queen Eurydice, had two brothers, one called Plator, by both
parents, the other Caravantius, by the same mother only.
The latter, as descended of ignoble ancestors on his father&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2090" id="Page_2090">Pg 2090</a></span>
side, was but little suspected; but, that his reign might be
more secure, he had put to death Plator, and two active men
his friends, Ettritus and Epicadus. It was rumoured, that
he was actuated by jealousy towards his brother, who had
engaged himself to Etuta, the daughter of Hononus, prince of
the Dardanians, as if, by that match, engaging that nation in
his interest; and this supposition was rendered the more
probable by Gentius marrying her, after the death of Plator.
From this time, when he was delivered from the fear of his
brother, he began to be oppressive to his subjects, and the
natural violence of his temper was inflamed by an immoderate
use of wine. Having been incited, as was mentioned above,
to a war with the Romans, he collected all his forces, amounting
to fifteen thousand men, at Lissus. From thence, detaching
his brother with one thousand foot and fifty horse, to
reduce, either by force or terror, the nation of the Cavians, he
marched himself to Bassania, a city five miles distant from
Lissus. The inhabitants were in alliance with Rome. Therefore, having
been first solicited by emissaries sent in advance, they
determined rather to endure a siege than surrender themselves.
In Cavia, the people of the town of Durnium cheerfully opened
their gates to Caravantius, on his arrival; but another town,
called Caravantis, refused him admittance; and whilst he was
carelessly ravaging their lands, many of his straggling soldiers
were killed by a muster of the peasants. By this time Appius
Claudius, having joined to the army he had in command some
bodies of auxiliaries, composed of Bulinians, Apollonians, and
Dyrrhachians, had left his winter quarters, and was encamped
near the river Genusus. Having heard of the treaty between
Persius and Gentius, and being highly provoked at the ill-treatment
of the outraged ambassadors, he was resolved
to make war upon him. The pr&aelig;tor Anicius, who was now
at Apollonia, being informed of what passed in Illyria, despatched
a letter to Appius, desiring him to wait for him
at the Genusus; and, in three days after, he arrived in the
camp. <i>Having added</i> to the auxiliary troops which he
then had, two thousand foot and two hundred horse of the
Parthinians, (the foot commanded by Epicadus, and the horse
by Agalsus,) he prepared to march into Illyria, chiefly that
he might relieve the Bassanians from the siege. But an
account brought him, of the sea-coast being ravaged by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2091" id="Page_2091">Pg 2091</a></span>
number of the enemy&#8217;s barks, checked his efforts. These
were eighty vessels, which, by the advice of Pantauchus, Gentius
had sent to waste the lands of the Dyrrhachians and
Apollonians. <i>The Roman fleet was then lying near Apollonia.
Anicius hastily repaired thither, soon overtook the Illyrian
plunderers, brought them to an engagement, and, defeating
them with very little trouble, took many of their ships, and
compelled the rest to retire to Illyria. Returning thence to
the camp at the Genusus, he hastened to the relief of Bassania.
Gentius did not bear up against the rumour of the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s
coming; but, raising the siege, retired to Scodra with such
precipitate haste, that he did not even take the whole of his
army with him. There was a large body of forces, which, if
their courage had been supported by the presence of their commander,
might have given some check to the Romans; but, as
he had withdrawn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> they surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h31" name="h31"></a>31</span>
The cities of that country, one after another, followed
the example; their own inclinations being encouraged by the
justice and clemency which the Roman pr&aelig;tor showed to all.
The army then advanced to Scodra, which was the chief
seat of the war, not merely because Gentius had chosen it
for the metropolis of his kingdom, but because it has by
far the strongest fortifications of any in the territory of
the Labeatians, and is of very difficult access. Two rivers
enclose it; the Clausula flowing past the eastern side of
the city, and by the western, the Barbanna, which rises out of
the lake Labeatus. These two rivers, uniting their streams,
fall into the river Oriuns, which, running down from
mount Scordus, and being augmented by many other waters,
empties itself into the Adriatic Sea. Mount Scordus is much
the highest hill in all that country; at its foot, towards the
east, lies Dardania; towards the south, Macedonia; and towards
the west, Illyria. Notwithstanding that the town was
so strong, from the nature of its situation, and was garrisoned
by the whole force of the Illyrian nation, with the king himself
at their head, yet the Roman pr&aelig;tor, encouraged by the
happy success of his first enterprises, and hoping that the
fortune of the whole undertaking would correspond to its
commencement, and thinking also that a sudden alarm might
have a powerful effect, advanced to the walls with his troops
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2092" id="Page_2092">Pg 2092</a></span>in order of battle. But, if the garrison had kept their gates
shut, and manned the walls and the towers of the gates with
soldiers, they might have repulsed the Romans from the walls
with their efforts frustrated, instead of which they marched
out from the gate, and, on equal ground, commenced a battle
with more courage than they supported it: for, being forced
to give way, and crowded together in their retreat, and above
two hundred having fallen in the very entrance of the gate,
the rest were so terrified, that Gentius immediately despatched
Teuticus and Bellus, two of the first men of the nation, to the
pr&aelig;tor, through whom he begged a truce, in order that he
might be able to deliberate on the state of his affairs. He
was allowed three days for the purpose, and, as the Roman
camp was about five hundred paces from the city, he went on
board a ship, and sailed up the river Barbanna, into the lake
of Labeatus, as if in search of a retired place for consultation;
but, as afterwards appeared, he was led by a groundless report,
that his brother Caravantius was coming, with many
thousands of soldiers collected in the country, to which he had
been sent. This rumour dying away, on the third day he
sailed down the river in the same ship to Scodra; and, after
sending forward messengers, to request permission to call
upon the pr&aelig;tor, and leave being given, came into the
camp. He began his discourse with reproaches against himself,
for the folly of his conduct; then descended to tears
and prayers, and, falling at the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s knees, gave himself
up into his power. He was at first desired to keep up his
spirits, and having been even invited to supper, he went back
into the city to his people, and, for that day, was entertained
by the pr&aelig;tor with every mark of respect. On the day following,
he was delivered into custody, to Caius Cassius, a
military tribune, having, though a king, received ten talents,
scarcely the hire of a party of gladiators, and that from a king,
to reduce himself to these circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h32" name="h32"></a>32</span>
The first thing Anicius did, after taking possession of
Scodra, was, to order the ambassadors, Petilius and Perperna,
to be sought for and brought to him; and having restored to
them their former dignity, he immediately despatched Perperna
to seize the king&#8217;s friends and relations, who, hastening
to Medeo, a city of Labeatia, conducted to the camp at Scodra,
Etleva, the king&#8217;s consort; his brother Caravantius; with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2093" id="Page_2093">Pg 2093</a></span>
two sons, Scerdiletus and Pleuratus. Anicius, having brought
the Illyrian war to a conclusion within thirty days, sent Perperna
to Rome with the news of his success; and, in a few
days after, king Gentius himself, with his mother, queen, children,
and brother, and other Illyrians of distinction. This
one war was announced at Rome as finished before it was
known to have been begun. At the time when these things
took place, Perseus laboured under dreadful apprehensions,
on account of the approach, both of the new consul &AElig;milius,
who, as he heard, was coming with formidable threats, and also
of the pr&aelig;tor Octavius: nor did he less dread the Roman fleet,
and the danger which threatened the sea-coast. Eumenes
and Athenagoras commanded at Thessalonica, with a small
garrison of two thousand targeteers. Thither he sent Androcles,
as governor, and ordered him to keep the troops encamped
close by the naval arsenals. He ordered one thousand horse,
under Antigonus, to &AElig;nia, to guard the sea-coast; directing
them, whenever they should hear of the enemy&#8217;s fleet approaching
the shore in any part, instantly to hasten thither, to protect
the country people. Five thousand Macedonians were
sent to garrison the mountains Pythium and Petra, commanded
by Histi&aelig;us, Theogenes, and Medon. After making these detachments,
he set about fortifying the bank of the river Enipeus,
the channel being dry and fordable; and, in order that
all the men might apply themselves to this work, the women
were obliged to bring provisions from the neighbouring cities
into the camp. He ordered the soldiers to <i>fetch timber</i> from
the woods which were not far distant. <i>Then a mound was
formed and works thrown up strengthened with towers and
with engines, disposed in various parts so that the enemy might
not be able to force a way through without great opposition
and danger. Thus he trusted that he should be secure against
every attack of the Romans, and that, wearied out with inaction
and slow delay, and drained by expenses, a disgust at so
difficult a war would seize on the mind of the enemy. On the
other side, the more diligence and caution Paullus saw the Macedonians
use, the more assiduously did he study to devise some
means of frustrating those hopes, which the enemy had not
without reason conceived. But he suffered immediate distress
from the scarcity of water, as the neighbouring river was almost</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2094" id="Page_2094">Pg 2094</a></span>
<i>dried up, except that a little stream, and that impure,
flowed in the part contiguous to the sea.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h33" name="h33"></a>33</span>
<i>The consul, when those who were sent to search the
neighbourhood announced that no water could be found</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> at
last ordered the water-carriers to attend him to the shore,
which was not three hundred paces distant, and there to dig
holes in several places, not far from each other. The great
height of the mountains gave him reason to suppose that they
contained hidden springs of water, the veins of which flowing
through to the sea, mingled with its waves; and the more
so, as they discharged no streams above ground. Scarcely was
the surface of the sand removed, when springs began to boil
up, small at first, and muddy, but in a little time they threw
out clear water in great plenty, as if through the favourable
interference of the gods. This circumstance added greatly to
the reputation and influence of the general in the minds of the
soldiers. He then ordered them to get ready their arms; and
went himself, with the tribunes and first centurions, to examine
the fords, in hopes of finding a passage, where the
descent would be easy for the troops, and where the ascending
the other bank would be least difficult. After taking a
sufficient view of these matters, he made it his first care to
provide, that, in the movements of the army, every thing
should be done regularly, and without noise, at the first order
and beck of the general. When notice was proclaimed of what
was to be done to all at the same time, every one did not distinctly
hear; and as the orders received were not clear, some
making additions for themselves, did more than was ordered,
while others did less; while dissonant shouts were raised in
every quarter, insomuch that the enemy knew sooner than the
soldiers themselves what was intended. He therefore directed,
that the military tribune should communicate, secretly, to the
first centurion of the legion, then he to the next, and that so
on, in order that each should tell the next to him in rank what
was requisite to be done, whether the instructions were to be
conveyed from front to rear, or from rear to front. He likewise,
by a new arrangement, forbade the sentinels to carry
their shields when on duty; for as a sentinel did not go to
fight, but to watch, he had no occasion for arms; it was his
duty, when he perceived an enemy approaching, to retire, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2095" id="Page_2095">Pg 2095</a></span>to rouse the rest to arms. They used to stand with their helmets
on, and their shields erected on the ground before them;
when tired, they leaned on their spears; or laying their heads
on the edge of their shields, stood dozing in such a manner,
that from the glittering of their arms they could be seen afar
off by the enemy, while themselves could see nothing. He
likewise altered the practice of the advanced guards. Formerly,
the guards were kept on duty through the whole day, all
under arms, the horsemen with their horses bridled; and when
this happened in summer, under a continual scorching sun,
both men and horses were so much exhausted by the heat and
the languor contracted in so many hours, that very often, when
attacked by fresh troops, a few could get the better of a greater
number. He therefore ordered, that they should retire from
the morning-watch at noon, and that others should succeed to
the duty for the rest of the day; by which means the enemy
could never come fresh upon them when they were wearied.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h34" name="h34"></a>34</span>
&AElig;milius, after publishing, in a general assembly, his
orders for these regulations, added a speech of similar purport
to that which he had made in the city, that &#8220;it was the business
of the commander alone to consider what was proper to
be done, sometimes singly, sometimes in conjunction with those
whom he should call to council; and that such as were not
called, ought not to pronounce their opinions either in public
or in private. That it was a soldier&#8217;s business to attend to
these three things,&mdash;his body, that he may keep it in perfect
strength and agility; his arms, in good order; and his provisions
ready, in case of a sudden order; and to understand, that all
other matters relating to him are under the care of the immortal
gods and his captain. That in any army, where the
soldiers formed plans, and that the chief was drawn, first one
way, then another, by the rumours of the multitude, nothing
was successful. For his part,&#8221; he declared, that &#8220;he would
take care, as was the duty of a general, to afford them
occasion of acting with success. On their part, they were to
make no inquiries whatever as to what was about to take
place; but, when the signal was given, to discharge the duty
of a soldier.&#8221; After these precepts, he dismissed the assembly,
while the veterans themselves acknowledged, that
on that day, for the first time, they had, like recruits, been
taught the business of a soldier. Nor did they, by such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2096" id="Page_2096">Pg 2096</a></span>
expressions only, demonstrate with what perfect conviction
they had listened to the consul&#8217;s discourse; but the practical
effect of it was immediate. In the whole camp, not one person
was to be seen idle; some were sharpening their weapons;
others scouring their helmets and cheek-pieces, their shields
and breastplates; some fitted their armour to their bodies
and tested the agility of their limbs under it; some brandished
their spears, others flourished their swords, and tried the
points; so that it could be easily perceived that their intention
was, whenever they should come to battle, to finish the war
at once, either by a splendid victory or a memorable death.
On the other side, when Perseus saw that, in consequence of
the arrival of the consul, and of the opening of the spring, all
was motion and bustle among the Romans, as in a new war;
and that the camp had been removed from Phila and pitched
on the opposite bank, and that the Roman general employed
himself busily, sometimes in going round and examining all
his works, doubtless looking out for a place to pass the river;
<i>and sometimes in preparing every thing requisite for attack or
defence of a camp, with the closest attention, and omitted
nothing which could be attempted or achieved by a great
general, whether against the enemy or for increasing the efficiency
of his own men; he (Perseus) also exerted himself no
less diligently on his part to rouse the courage of his soldiers,
and add more and more strength to his defences, as if he were
approaching the crisis of the whole business, and never considered
all matters to be adequately provided for, or the bank
sufficiently fortified and secured. Nevertheless, amidst this
most vehement ardour on both sides, their camps were for some
time in a state of tranquillity. Nor was it ever recorded that
such powerful armies, with their camps pitched so near together,
had ever lain so quiet.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h35" name="h35"></a>35</span>
<i>In the mean time, a report announced that king Gentius
had been defeated, in Illyria, by the pr&aelig;tor Anicius; and
that himself, his family, and his whole kingdom, were in the
hands of the Romans</i>; which event greatly raised the spirits
of the Romans, and struck no small degree of terror into the
Macedonians and their king. At first, Perseus endeavoured
to suppress the intelligence, and sent messengers to Pantauchus,
who was on his way from that country, forbidding him
to come near the camp; but some of his people had already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2097" id="Page_2097">Pg 2097</a></span>
seen certain boys, carried away among the Illyrian hostages;
and it is certain that the more pains there are used to conceal
any circumstances, the more readily they are divulged, through
the gossiping disposition of the attendants of kings. About
this time, ambassadors came to the camp from Rhodes, with
the same message which had excited so much resentment in
the Roman senate. They were now heard by the council in
the camp with much greater indignation than at Rome; some
<i>even advised</i> that they should be instantly driven out of
the camp without any reply; but the consul said, that he
would give them an answer in fifteen days. Meanwhile, to
show how far the influence of the Rhodians as mediators extended,
he began to consult on the plan of carrying forward the
war. Some, particularly the older officers, advised to force
their way across the Enipeus, and through the enemy&#8217;s
works. &#8220;When they should advance in close order and make
an assault, the Macedonians,&#8221; they said, &#8220;would never be
able to withstand them. They had been, last year, beaten
out of many fortresses much higher and better fortified, which
they had occupied with much stronger garrisons.&#8221; Others
recommended, that Octavius, with the fleet, should sail to
Thessalonica; and, by committing depredations on the sea-coast,
to divide the king&#8217;s forces; so that when, on the appearance
of another enemy behind him, he should turn about to
protect the interior part of the kingdom, he would be forced
to leave a passage over the Enipeus open in some place or
other. The consul himself was of opinion, that the nature of
the bank, and the works erected on it, presented insuperable
difficulties; and, besides its being every where furnished
with engines, he had been informed, that the enemy were remarkable
for using missile weapons with uncommon skill, and
with a very certain aim. The consul&#8217;s full conviction leaned
quite another way; as soon, therefore, as the council broke up,
he sent for Sch&#339;nus and Menophilus, Perrh&aelig;bian merchants,
whom he knew to be men of probity and good sense, and examined
them in private about the nature of the passes leading
into Perrh&aelig;bia. They told him, that the places themselves
were not difficult; but that they were occupied by parties of
the king&#8217;s troops; from which he conceived hopes of being
able to beat off those parties, by making a sudden attack with
a strong force in the night, when they were off their guard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2098" id="Page_2098">Pg 2098</a></span>
For he considered that &#8220;javelins, and arrows, and other missile
weapons, were useless in the dark, when one cannot see at
distance what to aim at; but that, when combatants closed together
in a throng, the business must depend on the sword, in
which the Roman soldier was superior.&#8221; He resolved to
employ those two men as guides; and, sending for the pr&aelig;tor
Octavius, explained to him what he intended, ordering him
to sail directly with the fleet to Heracleum, and to have in
readiness, there, ten days&#8217; provisions for one thousand men.
He then sent Publius Scipio Nasica, and Quintus Fabius Maximus,
his own son, with five thousand chosen men, to Heracleum,
as if they were to embark in the fleet, to ravage the coast
of the interior parts of Macedonia, as had been proposed in
the council. He told them, in private, that there were provisions
prepared for them on board, so that they should have
no delay. He then ordered the guides to divide the road in
such a manner that they might attack Pythium at the fourth
watch on the third day. He himself, on the day following, in
order to withdraw the king from the observation of other matters,
attacked his advanced guards as soon as it was light in the
middle of the channel of the river, where the fight was maintained
by the light infantry on both sides, for the bottom was
so uneven, that heavy arms could not be used. The slope of
each bank was three hundred paces long, and the breadth of
the channel, which was of various depths, somewhat more
than a mile. In this middle space the fight was carried on,
while the king on one side, and the consul with his legions on
the other, stood spectators on the ramparts of their camps. At
a distance, the king&#8217;s troops had the advantage in fighting
with missile weapons; but in close fight the Roman soldier
was more steady, and was better defended, either with a target
or a Ligurian buckler. About noon, the consul ordered the
signal of retreat to be given, and thus the battle ended for that
day, after considerable numbers had fallen on both sides.
Next morning at sun-rise, the fight was renewed with greater
fury, as their passions had been irritated by the former contest;
but the Romans were wounded, not only by those
with whom they were immediately engaged, but much more
by the multitudes that stood posted in the towers, with missiles
of every sort, particularly stones; so that whenever
they advanced towards the enemy&#8217;s bank, the weapons thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2099" id="Page_2099">Pg 2099</a></span>
from the engines reached even the hindmost of their men.
The consul, having lost far more men on that day, somewhat
later called off his men. On the third day he declined fighting,
and moved down to the lowest side of the camp, as if intending
to attempt a passage through an intrenchment which
stretched down to the sea. Perseus, <i>who did not extend his
cares beyond</i> the objects that lay before his eyes, <i>bent all his
thoughts and exertions to stop the progress of the enemy in the
quarter where he lay, careful of nought beside. In the mean
time, Publius Nasica, with the detachment assigned to him,
having departed towards the sea to Heracleum, when he arrived
there, waited for nightfall, ordering his soldiers to refresh themselves.
He then explained to the principal of his officers the
real directions of the consul, and when first the darkness
spread itself, bending his course to the mountain, he led his
troops in silence to Pythium, as he had been commanded.
When they had arrived at the very summit, which rises to a
height of more than ten stadia, some repose was given to the
wearied soldiers. This height, as has been already stated, Medon,
Histi&aelig;us, and Theogenes, who were sent by Perseus, were occupying
with five thousand Macedonians, but so great was the
negligence of the king&#8217;s generals, that no one perceived that the
Romans were approaching. If we are to believe Polybius,
Nasica, having attacked them while asleep, easily dislodged
them from the height. Nasica himself however, narrates the
affair very differently in a letter to one of the kings. He says,
that the mountain was of steep ascent, but so unguarded that
he could have taken possession of the pass with no trouble, had
not a deserter from those Cretans, whom he was taking with
him, fled to Perseus, and informed him what was being done.
That the king himself remained in his camp, but sent two
thousand Macedonians and ten thousand auxiliaries, with
Medon as their leader, to take possession of the pass. That
with these a most fierce engagement took place on the top of
the hill, and, among other things, that he himself was thrust at
with a sword by a Thracian soldier, whom he transfixed by
driving his spear through his breast. That at length the Macedonians,
being conquered, gave way, and that their leader
himself, throwing away his arms, sought safety in a disgraceful
flight. The Romans pursuing the fugitives had an easy
descent, without any danger, to the plain. In this stale of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2100" id="Page_2100">Pg 2100</a></span>
things Perseus was in perplexity as to what was necessary to
be done, as he feared lest, now that a way through the pass had
been opened, he should be hemmed in by the Romans. It was
absolutely necessary that he should either retire to Pydna, and
await the enemy there, so as to fight with less danger under
the walls of a fortified city; or that, dispersing his forces
through the cities of Macedonia, conveying the corn and cattle
into more fortified places, and devastating the fields, he, should
leave the bare soil to the enemy. The mind of the king fluctuated
irresolute between these two propositions: his friends,
thinking that that which was the most honourable would also
be the safer, advised him to try the fortune of a battle, alleging
both that he was superior in the number of his soldiers, and
that he ought surely to trust to that valour which, while it was
natural to their minds, would be inflamed by the most powerful
and sacred incitements to a valiant opposition which could
act upon men;&mdash;their altars, their hearths, and their religious
institutions, amidst which and for which they had to fight;
their parents and their wives, and, lastly, their king himself
observing them, and exposing himself to a share of the danger.
Influenced by these suggestions, the king prepared himself for
a battle, and when he had retired to Pydna, at once pitched
his camp, drew up his army, and assigned to each of his leaders
his position and duty, as if about to fight immediately after
the march. The locality was of this hind; the plain was
suited for the ranging of the phalanx, which requires an open
and even space, not, however, such as that it could be easily
moved forward; then there were continuous hills which afforded
to the light-armed troops the means of retreating at one time,
and at another of wheeling round. Two streams, the one
of which the inhabitants called &#338;son, the other Leucus, though
they flowed with but a scanty supply of water, yet seemed
likely to occasion some trouble to the Romans. &AElig;milius, having
united his forces with Nasica, set out directly against the
enemy, but at the sight of their army, which was most effective
both as to the number and the strength of the soldiers, and
admirably drawn up and ranged for battle, he stopped, struck
with awe, and revolving many considerations within himself.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h36" name="h36"></a>36</span>
<i>The season of the year</i><a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> was a little after the summer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2101" id="Page_2101">Pg 2101</a></span>solstice; the time of the day was approaching towards noon;
and his march had been performed amidst great quantities
of dust, and the increasing heat of the sun. Lassitude and
thirst were already felt, and both would certainly be aggravated
by mid-day coming on. He resolved, therefore, not to
expose his men in that condition to an enemy, fresh and in
full vigour; but so great was the ardour for battle in the
minds of both parties, that the general had occasion for as
much art to elude the wishes of his own men, as those of the
enemy. He urged the military tribunes to hasten the forming
of the troops, went himself round the ranks, and with
exhortations inflamed their courage for the fight. At first,
they called to him for the signal briskly; but afterwards, as
the beat increased, their looks became less lively, and their
voices fainter, while many stood resting on their shields, or leaning
on their javelins. He then, at length, openly ordered
the foremost ranks to measure out the front of a camp, and
store the baggage; on seeing which, some undisguisedly rejoiced
that he had not compelled them to fight when they were
wearied with marching and with the scorching heat. Immediately
about the general were the lieutenants-general, and
the commanders of the foreign troops; among others Attalus,
who, when they thought that the consul intended to fight,
(for even to them he did not disclose his intention of delaying,)
had all approved the measure. On this sudden alteration
of his plan, while the rest were silent, Nasica alone of
them all ventured to advise the consul, not to let slip from his
hands an enemy, who, by shunning a battle, had baffled former
commanders. &#8220;There was reason to fear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
if he should march off in the night, he would have to be pursued
with extreme toil and danger, into the heart of Macedonia;
and the troops must be led about, as under former
generals, wandering through the glens and forests of the
Macedonian mountains. He therefore earnestly recommended
to attack the enemy while he had him in an open plain, and
not to lose the opportunity of obtaining a victory, which now
presented itself.&#8221; The consul, not in the least offended at the
frank advice of so illustrious a youth, answered: &#8220;Nasica, I
once thought as you do now; hereafter you will come to think
as I do. By the many chances of war, I have learned when it
is proper to fight, when to abstain from fighting. It would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2102" id="Page_2102">Pg 2102</a></span>
not be right in me, at present, standing at the head of the troops
to explain to you the causes that render it better to rest to-day.
Ask my reasons some other time. At present you will acquiesce
in the judgment of an old commander.&#8221; The youth was
silent, concluding that the consul certainly saw some objections
to fighting, which did not appear to him.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h37" name="h37"></a>37</span>
Paullus, as soon as he saw the camp marked out, and
the baggage laid up, drew off, first, the veterans from the rear
line, then the first-rank men, while the spearmen stood in the
front, lest the enemy might make any attempt; and lastly, the
spearmen, beginning at the right wing, and leading them
away, gradually, by single companies. Thus were the infantry
drawn off without tumult; and, in the mean time, the
cavalry and light infantry faced the enemy; nor were the
cavalry recalled from their station, until the rampart and
trench were finished. The king, though he was disposed to
have given battle that day, was yet satisfied; since his men
knew, that, the delay was owing to the enemy: and he led
back his troops to their station. When the camp had been
thoroughly fortified, Caius Sulpicius Gallus, a military tribune
of the second legion, who had been pr&aelig;tor the year before,
with the consul&#8217;s permission collected the soldiers in
assembly, and gave them notice, lest they should any of them
consider the matter as a prodigy, that, &#8220;on the following night,
the moon would be eclipsed, from the second hour to the
fourth.&#8221; He mentioned that, &#8220;as this happened in the course
of nature, at stated times, it could be known, and foretold.
As, therefore, they did not wonder at the regular rising and
setting of the sun and moon, or at the moon&#8217;s sometimes shining
with a full orb, and sometimes in its wane, showing only
small horns, so neither ought they to construe as a portent, its
being obscured when covered with the shadow of the earth.&#8221;
When on the night preceding the day before the nones of
September, at the hour mentioned, the eclipse took place, the
Roman soldiers thought the wisdom of Gallus almost divine;
but the Macedonians were shocked, as at a dismal prodigy,
foreboding the fall of their kingdom and the ruin of their nation;
nor did their soothsayers explain it otherwise. There
was shouting and yelling in the camp of the Macedonians, until
the moon emerged forth into its full light. Both armies
had been so eager for an engagement, that, next day, both the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2103" id="Page_2103">Pg 2103</a></span>
king and the consul were censured by many of their respective
men for having separated without a battle. The king could
readily excuse himself, not only as the enemy had led back
his troops into camp, openly declining a battle; but, also, as
he had posted his men on ground of such a nature, that the
phalanx (which even a small inequality of surface renders
useless) could not advance on it. The consul, besides appearing
to have neglected an opportunity of fighting, and to have
given the enemy room to go off in the night, if he were so inclined,
was thought to waste time at the present, under pretence
of offering sacrifice, though the signal had been displayed, at
the first light, for going out to the field. At last, about the
third hour, the sacrifices being duly performed, he summoned
a council, and there, too, he was deemed by several to spin
out, in talking and unseasonable consultation, the time that
ought to be employed in action; after the conversation, however,
the consul addressed to them the following speech.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h38" name="h38"></a>38</span>
&#8220;Publius Nasica, a youth of uncommon merit, was the
only one of those who were for fighting yesterday, that disclosed
his sentiments to me; and even he was afterwards silent,
so that he seems to have come over to my opinion. Some
others have thought proper, rather to carp at their general
in his absence, than to offer advice in his presence. Now, I
shall, without the least reluctance, make known to you, Publius
Nasica, and to any who, with less openness, entertained the
same opinion with you, my reasons for deferring an engagement.
For, so far am I from being sorry for yesterday&#8217;s inaction,
that I am convinced that by that course I preserved the
army. And if any of you think that I hold this opinion groundlessly,
let him come forward, if he pleases, and take with me
a review of how many things were favourable to the enemy
and adverse to us. In the first place, how far they surpass us
in numbers, I am sure not one of you was at any time ignorant;
and yesterday, I am convinced that you must have observed
it, when you saw their line drawn out. Of our small
force, a fourth part had been left to guard the baggage; and
you know that they are not the worst of the soldiers who are
left in custody of the baggage. But suppose we were all here,
can we believe it a matter of little moment, that, with the
blessing of the gods, we shall this day, if judged proper, or tomorrow
at farthest, march to battle out of this our own camp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2104" id="Page_2104">Pg 2104</a></span>
where we have lodged last night? Is there no difference
whether you order a soldier to take arms in his own tent,
when he has not suffered any fatigue on that day, either from
a long march or laborious work; after he has enjoyed his
natural rest, and is fresh; so as to lead him into the field
vigorous both in body and mind; or whether, when he is
wearied by such a march, or fatigued with carrying a load;
while he is wet with sweat, and while his throat is parched
with thirst, and his mouth and eyes filled with dust, you oppose
him, under a scorching noon-day sun, to an enemy who
has had full repose, and who brings into the battle his strength
unimpaired by any previous circumstance? Is there, in the
name of the gods, any one so dastardly, that, if matched in
this manner, he would not overcome the bravest man? We
must consider, that the enemy had, quite at their leisure,
formed their line of battle; had recruited their spirits, and
were standing in regular order; whereas we must have formed
our line in hurry and confusion, and have engaged before
it was completed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h39" name="h39"></a>39</span>
&#8220;We should then confessedly have an irregular and
disorderly line, but should we have had a camp fortified, a
watering-place provided, and the passage to it secured by
troops, and all the country round reconnoitred; or should we
have been without any one spot of our own, except the naked
field on which we fought? Your fathers considered a fortified
camp as a harbour of safety in all the emergencies of an army;
out of which they were to march to battle, and in which, after
being tossed in the storm of the fight, they had a safe retreat.
For that reason, besides enclosing it with works, they strengthened
it further with a numerous guard; for any general who
lost his camp, though he should have been victorious in the
field, yet was deemed vanquished. A camp is a residence for
the victorious, a refuge for the conquered. How many armies,
to whom the fortune of the fight has been adverse, when
driven within their ramparts, have, at their own time, and
sometimes the next moment, sallied out and defeated their
victors! This military settlement is another native country
to every soldier: the rampart is as the wall of his city, and
his own tent his habitation and his home. Should we have
fought while in that unsettled state, and without quarters
prepared, to which, even if victorious, we might retire? In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2105" id="Page_2105">Pg 2105</a></span>
opposition to these considerations of the difficulties and impediments
to the fighting at that time, one argument is urged:
What if the enemy had marched off in the course of last
night? What immense fatigue, it is observed, must have
been undergone in pursuing him to the remotest parts of Macedonia!
But, for my part, I take it as a certainty, that if he had
had any intention of retreating, he would neither have waited,
nor drawn out his troops to battle. For, how much more
easily could he have gone off while we were at a great distance,
than now, when we are close behind him! Nor could
he escape observation in departing either by day or by night.
What could be more desirable to us, who were obliged to attack
their camp, defended as it was by a very high bank of a river,
and enclosed likewise with a rampart and a number of towers,
than that they should quit their fortifications, and, marching
off with haste, give us an opportunity of attacking their rear
in an open plain? These were the reasons for deferring a battle
from yesterday to this day. For I am myself also inclined
to fight; and for that reason, as the way to come at the enemy
over the river Enipeus was stopped, I have opened a new way,
by dislodging the enemy&#8217;s guards from another pass. Nor
will I rest until I shall have brought the war to a conclusion.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h40" name="h40"></a>40</span>
Silence ensued after this address; for some were convinced
by his arguments, and the rest were fearful of giving
offence needlessly in a matter which, from whatever cause overlooked,
could not now be regained. Even on that day, neither
the king nor the consul was desirous of engaging; not the
king, because he was not going, as on the day before,
to attack men who were fatigued after their march, were
hurried in forming their line, and not completely marshalled;
nor the consul, because, in his new camp, no collection was
yet made of wood or forage, to bring which from the adjacent
country a great number of his men had gone forth from the
camp. Still fortune, whose power prevails over all human
schemes, brought about a battle. Nearer to the enemy&#8217;s
camp was a river, not very large, from which both parties supplied
themselves with water; and that this might be done with
safety, guards were stationed on each bank. On the Roman
side were two cohorts, a Marrucinian and a Pelignian, with
two troops of Samnite horse, commanded by a lieutenant-general,
Marcus Sergius Silus; and in the front of the camp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2106" id="Page_2106">Pg 2106</a></span>
there was posted another guard, under Caius Cluvius, lieutenant-general,
composed of three cohorts, a Firmian, a Vestinian, and
a Cremonian; besides two troops of horse, a Placentine and
an &AElig;sernian. While there was quiet at the river, neither
party making an attack; about the ninth hour, a horse, breaking
loose from those who had the care of him, ran off towards
the farther bank, and three Roman soldiers followed him
through the water, which was about as high as their knees.
At the same time two Thracians endeavoured to bring the
horse from the middle of the channel to their own bank; but
one of these having been slain, and the horse having been recovered,
they retired to their post. On the enemy&#8217;s bank there
was a body of eight hundred Thracians, of whom a few, at
first enraged at their countryman being killed before their
eyes, crossed the river in pursuit of his slayers; in a little
time some more, and at last all of them, and engaged with
the guard which defended the bank on the Roman side. Some
authors say, that by the command of Paullus, the horse was
driven without a bridle to the enemy&#8217;s side, and men sent to
bring him back, in order that the enemy might first provoke
the conflict. For when favourable auspices were not obtained
by the first twenty victims, at length the haruspices declared,
&#8220;that the entrails of the twenty-first portended victory to the
Romans, provided they acted only upon the defensive, without
striking the first blow.&#8221; However, whether by the design of
the leader or by accident, the battle was certainly brought
about from this commencement, and, in a short time, was so
augmented by party after party on both sides flying to carry
succour to their comrades, that the commanders were compelled
to come down to a general decision of the contest; for
&AElig;milius, on hearing the tumult, came forth from his tent,
and when it seemed neither easy nor safe to recall or stop the
impetuosity of those who were rushing to arms, he thought it
best to avail himself of the ardour of the soldiers, and to turn
an accident into an opportunity. He therefore led out his
forces from the camp, and riding among their ranks exhorted
them to enter upon the contest they had so greatly desired
with corresponding ardour. At the same time Nasica, having
been sent forward to reconnoitre what was the position of
affairs amongst those who were engaged in the commencing
conflict, announced that Perseus was approaching with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2107" id="Page_2107">Pg 2107</a></span>
army in battle-array. First marched the Thracians, men of
fierce countenance and tall of stature, and protected on their
left side by bucklers which shone with remarkable brightness.
A black cloak covered both shoulders, and on their
right they brandished from time to time a sword of enormous
weight. Next to the Thracians stood the hired auxiliaries,
their armour and costume differing according to their respective
nations; and among these were some P&aelig;onians. Next
came a band of the Macedonians themselves, which they called
the phalanx of the Leucaspides. A few selected for their
strength and valour were more conspicuous, shining in gilded
armour and scarlet cloaks: this was the middle of the army.
These were succeeded by those whom they called Chalcaspides,
from their brazen and glittering bucklers. This phalanx was
placed next to the other on the right wing. Besides these
two phalanxes, which constituted the chief strength of the
Macedonian army, the targeteers, who were also Macedonians,
and carried pikes like those of the phalanx, but in other respects
more lightly armed, were distributed on the wings
advanced, and projecting beyond the rest of the line. The
plain was illuminated with the brightness of their arms, the
neighbouring hills echoed with their shouts, as they mutually
cheered each other on. Such was the swiftness and boldness
of all these forces as they came out to the fight, that those who
were first slain fell at two hundred and fifty paces from the
Roman camp. Meanwhile &AElig;milius advanced, and when he
saw not only the other Macedonians, but those who constituted
the phalanx, some with their bucklers, and some with
their targets removed from their shoulders, and with their
pikes inclined in one direction receiving the attack of the
Romans, admiring the firmness of the serried ranks, and the
bristling rampart of outstretched pikes, he was smitten at
once with astonishment and terror, as if he had never seen so
fearful a spectacle, and was afterwards in the habit of frequently
referring to it, and making this statement respecting
himself. Carefully concealing however at the time the agitation
of his troubled mind, he with serene countenance and
careless aspect, and with his head and body undefended, drew
up his line. The Pelignians were now fighting against the
targeteers, who were ranged opposite to them, and when, after
long and laborious efforts, they were unable to break through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2108" id="Page_2108">Pg 2108</a></span>
that compact array, Salius, who was commanding the Pelignians,
seized a standard and threw it among the enemy. On
this a prodigious conflict was excited, whilst on the one side the
Pelignians strove with all their might to recover the standard,
the Macedonians on the other to retain possession of it. The
former strove either to cut through the long spears of the
Macedonians, or to repel them with the bosses of their bucklers,
or in some instances to turn them aside even with their
naked hands, while the latter drove them firmly grasped with
both hands with such force against the enemy, who rushed on
with rash and heedless fury, that, penetrating shields and
bucklers, they overthrew the men transfixed in like manner.
The first ranks of the Pelignians having been thus defeated,
those who stood behind them were also cut down, and the rest
retreated towards the mountain which the inhabitants call
Mount Olocrus, though not yet in open flight. On this the
grief of &AElig;milius burst forth, so that he even rent his robe with
mortification, for in other places as well he saw that his men
were hanging back and approaching with timidity that hedge
of steel, as it were, with which the Macedonian line bristled in
every part. But that skilful general observed that this conjunction
of the foe was not every where close, but that here
and there it opened with little interstices, either on account of
the unevenness of the ground, or on account of the very
length of its front, which was immensely extended, while
those who attempted to occupy higher ground were necessarily,
though unwillingly, separated from those who occupied
lower positions, or those who were slower from those who
were faster, and those who advanced from those who held
back, and lastly, those who pressed upon the enemy from those
who were repulsed. In order, therefore, entirely to break the
ranks of the enemy, and to distribute the irresistible attack of
the entire phalanx into a number of separate conflicts, he
commanded his men, that wherever they should see the line of
the enemy present openings, they should individually rush to
those spots, and insinuating themselves like a wedge into such
spaces, however narrow their extent, they should fight with
impetuosity. This order having been issued and spread
through the whole army, he led on in person one of the
legions to the battle.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h41" name="h41"></a>41</span>
The troops were impressed by the high dignity of his
office, the personal renown of the man, and, above all, by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2109" id="Page_2109">Pg 2109</a></span>
age: for, though more than sixty years old, he discharged the
duties of youth, taking on himself the principal share both of
the labour and danger. His legion filled up the space between
the targeteers and the phalanxes, and thus disunited the
enemy&#8217;s line. Behind him were the targeteers, and his front
faced the shielded phalanx of Chalcaspides. Lucius Albinus,
a man of consular rank, was ordered to lead on the second
legion against the phalanx of the Leucaspides, which formed
the centre of the enemy&#8217;s line. On the right wing, where
the fight began, at the river, he brought forward the elephants,
with the cohorts of allied cavalry; and from this
quarter the retreat of the Macedonians first began. For as
new contrivances generally make an important figure in the
words of men, but on being put in practice ofttimes prove vain
and ineffectual, so on that occasion the elephants in the line of
battle were a mere name, without the least use. Their attack
was followed by the Latin allies, who forced the enemy&#8217;s left
wing to give way. In the centre, the second legion charged
and dispersed the phalanx; nor was there any more evident
cause of the victory, than there being many distinct fights,
which first disordered that body, when it wavered, and at last
quite broke it. Its force, while it is compact and bristling
with extended spears, is irresistible; but if, by attacking them
separately, you force them to turn about their spears, which,
on account of their length and weight, are unwieldy, they are
mingled in a confused mass; and, if any disorder arises on
the flank or rear, they fall into irretrievable disorder. Thus,
now, they were obliged to oppose the Romans in small parties,
and with their own line broken into numerous divisions; and
the Romans, when any opening was made, worked themselves
into their ranks. But had they advanced with their entire
line, straight against the phalanx when in its regular order,
just as happened to the Pelignians, who, in the beginning of
the battle, incautiously engaged the targeteers; they would
have impaled themselves on the spears, and would have been
unable to withstand such a firm body.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h42" name="h42"></a>42</span>
But though a massacre was made of the infantry on all
sides, except those who threw away their arms and fled, the
cavalry quitted the field with scarcely any loss. The king
himself was the first in flight. With the sacred squadrons of
horse he took the road to Pella, and was quickly followed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2110" id="Page_2110">Pg 2110</a></span>
Cotys and the Odrysian cavalry. The other wings of the Macedonians,
likewise, went off with full ranks: because, as the line
of infantry stood in the way, the slaughter of them detained the
conquerors, and made them careless of pursuing the cavalry.
For a long time, the men of the phalanx were cut off, in front,
on the flanks, and on the rear; at last, such as could avoid the
enemy&#8217;s hands, fled unarmed towards the sea; some even ran
into the water, and, stretching out their hands to those on
board the fleet, humbly begged their lives. And when they
saw boats coming from all the ships, supposing that they were
coming to take them in rather than to slay them, advanced
farther into the water, so that some of them even swam. But,
when they were cut to pieces as enemies by the boats, such as
were able regained the land by swimming back, where they
met with a more dreadful death; for the elephants, which their
riders had driven down to the shore, trod them under foot, and
crushed them in pieces. It was generally acknowledged, that
the Macedonians never lost so great a number of men in any
battle with the Romans; for their killed amounted to twenty
thousand; six thousand, who made their escape from the field
to Pydna, fell alive into the hands of the Romans, and five
thousand were taken straggling through the country. Of the
victorious army there fell not more than one hundred, the
greater part of whom were Pelignians; but a much greater
number were wounded. If the battle had been begun earlier,
so that the conquerors might have had daylight enough for a
pursuit, all their troops must have been utterly destroyed.
As it happened, the approach of night both screened the
fugitives, and made the Romans unwilling to follow them
through an unknown country.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h43" name="h43"></a>43</span>
Perseus fled as far as the Pierian wood, with a military
appearance, being attended by a numerous body of
horse, together with his royal retinue; but when he came
into the thicket, where there were numerous paths in different
directions, and when darkness came on, he turned out of the
main path with a very few, in whom he placed the greatest
confidence. The horsemen, abandoned by their leader, dispersed,
in different directions, to their respective homes; some
of whom made their way to Pella, quicker than Perseus himself,
because they went by the straight and open road. The
king was hindered by his fears and the many difficulties of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2111" id="Page_2111">Pg 2111</a></span>
the way, till near midnight. Perseus was met at the palace by
Euctus, governor of Pella, and the royal pages; but of all his
friends who had escaped from the battle by various chances, and
had reached Pella, not one would come near him, though they
were repeatedly sent for. Only three persons accompanied him
in his flight; Evander a Cretan, Neo a B&#339;otian, and Archidamus
an &AElig;tolian. With these he continued his retreat, at the
fourth watch; for he began to fear, lest those who had refused
to obey his summons, might, presently, attempt something more
audacious. He had an escort of about five hundred Cretans.
He took the road to Amphipolis; leaving Pella in the night,
and hastening to get over the river Axius before daylight, as
he thought that it, from the difficulty of passing it, would put
an end to the further pursuit of the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h44" name="h44"></a>44</span>
The consul, when he returned victorious to his camp,
to mar his entire joy, was much distressed by concern for his
younger son. This was Publius Scipio, who afterwards acquired
the title of Africanus by the destruction of Carthage.
He was, by birth, the son of the consul Paullus, and by adoption,
the grandson of the elder Africanus. He was then only
in the seventeenth year of his age, which circumstance heightened
his father&#8217;s anxiety; for, pursuing the enemy with eagerness,
he had been carried away by the crowd to a distant
part. But when he returned late in the evening, the consul,
having received his son in safety, felt unmixed joy for the
very important victory. When the news of the battle reached
Amphipolis, the matrons ran together to the temple of Diana,
whom they style Tauropolos, to implore her aid. Diodorus,
who was governor of the city, fearing lest the Thracians, of
whom there were two thousand in garrison, might, during the
confusion, plunder the city, contrived to receive in the middle
of the forum a letter through a person whom he had deceitfully
suborned to personate a courier. The contents of it were, that
&#8220;the Romans had put in their fleet at Emathia, and were ravaging
the territory round; and that the governors of Emathia
besought him to send a reinforcement to oppose the
ravagers.&#8221; After reading this, he desired the Thracians to
march to the relief of the coast of Emathia, telling them, as
an encouragement, that the Romans being dispersed through
the country, they might easily kill many of them, and gain
a large booty. At the same time he threw discredit on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2112" id="Page_2112">Pg 2112</a></span>
report of the defeat, alleging that, if it were true, many would
have come thither direct from the retreat. Having, on this
pretence, sent the Thracians out of the town, he no sooner
saw them pass the river Strynion, than he shut the gates.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h45" name="h45"></a>45</span>
On the third day after the battle, Perseus arrived at
Amphipolis, and sent thence to Paullus suppliant ambassadors,
with the wand of peace. In the mean time, Hippias Medon,
and Pantauchus, the principal friends of the king, went
themselves to the consul, and surrendered to the Romans
the city of Ber&#339;a, to which they had fled after the battle;
and several other cities, struck with fear, prepared to do the
same. The consul despatched to Rome, with letters and the
news of his victory, his son Quintus Fabius, Lucius Lentulus,
and Quintus Metellus. He gave to his infantry the spoils of
the enemy who were slain, and to his cavalry the plunder of
the circumjacent country, provided, however, that they did not
stay out of the camp longer than two nights. He himself then
removed nearer the sea towards Pydna. Ber&#339;a, Thessalonica,
and Pella, and indeed almost every city in Macedonia, successively
surrendered within two days. The inhabitants of
Pydna, which was the nearest, had not yet sent any ambassadors;
the confused multitude, made up of many different
nations, with the numbers who had been driven into one place
in their flight from the battle, embarrassed the counsels and
unanimity of the inhabitants; the gates, too, were not only
shut, but closed up with walls. Milo and Pantauchus were
sent to confer, under the wall, with Solon, who commanded in
the place. By his means the crowd of military people were sent
away, and the town was surrendered and given up to the soldiers
to be plundered. Perseus, after making a single effort
to procure the assistance of the Basaltians, to whom he had sent
ambassadors in vain, came forth into a general assembly, bringing
with him his son Philip, in order to encourage the Amphipolitans
themselves, and to raise the spirits of those horse
and foot soldiers who had either constantly accompanied him,
or had happened to fly to the same place. But, though he
made several attempts to speak, he was always stopped by his
tears; so that, finding himself unable to proceed, he told Evander,
the Cretan, what he wished to have laid before the people,
and came down from the tribunal. Although the multitude,
on observing the aspect of the king, and his pitiable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2113" id="Page_2113">Pg 2113</a></span>
weeping, had themselves sighed and wept with him, yet they
refused to listen to the discourse of Evander; and some, from
the middle of the assembly, had the assurance to interrupt
him, exclaiming, &#8220;Depart to some other place, that the few
of us who are left alive may not be destroyed on your account.&#8221;
Their daring opposition stopped Evander&#8217;s mouth. The king
retired to his palace; and, causing his treasures to be put on
board some barks which lay in the Strymon, went down himself
to the river. The Thracians would not venture to trust
themselves on board, but went off to their own homes, as did
the rest of the soldiers. The Cretans only followed in hope of
the money: but, as any distribution of it among them would
probably raise more discontent than gratitude, fifty talents<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
were laid for them on the bank, to be scrambled for. After
this scramble they went on board, yet in such hurry and disorder,
that they sunk one of the barks, which was swamped
by numbers in the mouth of the river. They arrived that day
at Galepsus, and the next at Samothrace, to which they were
bound. Thither it is said that as many as two thousand
talents<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> were conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="h46" name="h46"></a>46</span>
Paullus sent officers to hold the government of the several
cities which had surrendered; lest, at a time when peace
was but newly restored, the conquered might suffer any ill
treatment. He detained with himself the ambassadors of Perseus;
and, being uninformed of the flight of the king, detached
Publius Nasica, with a small party of horse and foot, to Amphipolis,
both that he might lay waste the country of Sintice, and be
ready to obstruct every effort of the king. In the mean time,
Melib&#339;a was taken and sacked by Cneius Octavius. At &AElig;ginium,
to which Cneius Anicius, a lieutenant-general, had been
despatched, two hundred men were lost by a sally made from
the town; the &AElig;ginians not being aware that the war was at
an end. The consul, quitting Pydna, arrived with his whole
army, on the second day, at Pella; and, pitching his camp at
the distance of a mile from it, remained in that station for
several days, reconnoitring on all sides the situation of the
city; and he perceived that it was chosen to be the capital of
the kingdom, not without good reason. It stands on a hill
which faces the south-west, and is surrounded by morasses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2114" id="Page_2114">Pg 2114</a></span>formed by stagnant waters from the adjacent lakes, so deep as
to be impassable either in winter or summer. In the part of
the morass nearest to the city the citadel rises up like an island,
being built on a mound of earth formed with immense
labour, so as to be capable of supporting the wall, and secure
against any injury from the water of the surrounding marsh. At
a distance it seems to join the city rampart, but is divided from
it by a river, and united by a bridge; so that if externally
invaded it has no access from any part, and if the king
chooses to confine any person within it, there is no way
for an escape except by that bridge, which can be guarded
with great ease. This was the depository of the royal treasure;
but, at that time, there was nothing found there but
the three hundred talents which had been sent to king Gentius,
and afterwards brought back. While they were stationed
at Pella, audience was given to a great number of embassies,
which came with congratulations, especially out of Thessaly.
Then, receiving intelligence that Perseus had passed over to
Samothrace, the consul departed from Pella, and after four
days&#8217; march, arrived at Amphipolis. Here the whole multitude
poured out of the town to meet him; a plain demonstration
that the people considered themselves not as <i>bereft of a
good and just king, but as delivered from a haughty tyrant.
Paullus having entered the city while engaged in religious
services, and performing a solemn sacrifice, the altar was suddenly
kindled by lightning, while all considered the event to
signify that the offerings of the consul were most acceptable to
the gods, since they were consecrated by fire from heaven.
The consul, after a short delay at Amphipolis, proceeded at
once in pursuit of Perseus, and also that he might carry his
victorious arms round to all the nations which had been under
his sway, made for the province of Odomantice, a region beyond
the river Strymon, and encamped at Sir&aelig;</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="bk45" id="bk45"></a>BOOK XLV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Perseus was captured by &AElig;milius Paulus in Samothrace. When Antiochus,
king of Syria, was besieging Ptolemy and Cleopatra, king and
queen of Egypt, and ambassadors were sent to him by the senate, to
order him to desist from besieging a king in alliance with Rome, on his
being informed of the mandates of the senate, he answered, that he
would consider what line of conduct he should adopt. Then Popilius,
one of the ambassadors, described, with his wand, a circle around the
king, and ordered him to give a decided answer before he passed it.
By which decided conduct he compelled the king to desist from the war.
The embassies of the nations and king, that came to congratulate the
Romans, were admitted into the senate-house, with the exception of the
embassy from the Rhodians, which was excluded because their feelings
in that war were opposed to the Roman people. The next day, when
the question was put &#8220;that war should be proclaimed against them,&#8221; the
Rhodian ambassadors pleaded the cause of their country before the senate,
and were dismissed in a manner that rendered it uncertain whether they
were looked on as enemies or allies. Macedon was reduced to the form
of a Roman province. &AElig;milius Paulus triumphed; although his own
soldiers opposed him, because they were dissatisfied with their share of
the plunder, and Servius Sulpicius Galba spoke against him; Perseus
and his three sons preceded his triumphal chariot. Still the joy of this
triumph was not unmingled, for it was rendered remarkable by the death
of his two sons: one of whom died before his father&#8217;s triumph; the
death of the other speedily followed. The ceremony of the conclusion of
the census was performed by the censors. Three hundred and twelve
thousand eight hundred and five citizens were enrolled. Prusias, king
of Bithynia, came to Rome, to congratulate the senate on the victory
gained over Macedon; and committed his son Nicomedes to the charge
of the senate: being full of servility, he called himself the freed-man of
the Roman people.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i1" name="i1"></a>1</span>
Although Quintus Fabius, Lucius Lentulus, and Quintus
Metellus, who were sent with the news of the victory,
made all possible haste to Rome, yet they found rejoicings for
that event anticipated there. The fourth day after the battle
with Perseus, while games were exhibiting in the circus, a
faint rumour spread itself suddenly among the people through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2116" id="Page_2116">Pg 2116</a></span>
all the seats, &#8220;that a battle had been fought in Macedon, and
that the king was entirely defeated.&#8221; The rumour gathered
strength, until at last arose shouting and clapping of hands,
as if certain tidings of victory were brought to them. The
magistrates were surprised, and caused inquiry to be made for
the originator of this sudden rejoicing; but as none was found,
the joy of course vanished, since the matter was uncertain;
yet the prestige of conquest still remained impressed on their
minds; and when, on the arrival of Fabius, Lentulus, and
Metellus, the fact was established by authentic information,
they rejoiced on a twofold account,&mdash;on that of the victory,
and their happy presage of it. This exultation in the circus
is related in another manner, with equal appearance of probability:
that on the fifteenth day before the calends of October,
being the second day of the Roman games, as the consul
Licinius was going down to give the signal for the race, a
courier, who said he came from Macedon, delivered to him
a letter decorated with laurel. As soon as he had started the
chariots, he mounted his own, and as he rode back through the
circus to the seats of the magistrates, showed to the people
the embellished tablets, at the sight of which the multitude,
regardless of the games, ran down at once into the middle of
the area. The consul held a meeting of the senate on the
spot; and after reading the letter to them, by their direction
told the people, before the seats of the magistrates, that &#8220;his
colleague, Lucius &AElig;milius, had fought a general engagement
with Perseus; that the Macedonian army was beaten and put
to flight; that the king had fled with few attendants; and
that all the states of Macedon had submitted to the Romans.&#8221;
On hearing this, a universal shouting and clapping of hands
arose among the commons; and most of them, leaving the
games, hastened home to communicate the joyful tidings to
their wives and children. This was the thirteenth day after
the battle was fought in Macedon.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i2" name="i2"></a>2</span>
On the following day a meeting of the senate was held
in the council-chamber, and a general supplication was voted,
and likewise a decree of the senate was passed, that the consul
should disband all his troops, excepting the legionary
soldiers and seamen; and that their disbandment should be
taken into consideration as soon as the deputies from the
consul &AElig;milius, who had sent forward the courier, should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2117" id="Page_2117">Pg 2117</a></span>
arrive in town. On the sixth day before the calends of
October, about the second hour, the deputies came into the
city, and proceeded directly to the tribunal in the forum,
drawing after them, wherever they went, an immense crowd,
composed of those who went forth to meet and escort them.
The senate happened to be then in the council-chamber, and
the consul introduced the deputies to them. They were
detained there no longer than to give an account, &#8220;how very
numerous the king&#8217;s forces of horse and foot had been; how
many thousands of them were killed, how many taken; with
what small loss of men the Romans had made such havoc of
the enemy, and with how small a retinue Perseus had fled;
that it was supposed he would go to Samothrace, and that
the fleet was ready to pursue him; so that he could not
escape, either by sea or land.&#8221; They were then brought out
into the assembly of the people, where they repeated the same
particulars, and the general joy was renewed in such a degree,
that no sooner had the consul published an order, &#8220;that all
the places of worship should be opened,&#8221; than every one proceeded,
with as much speed as he could use, to return thanks
to the gods, and the temples of the immortal gods, throughout
the entire city, were filled with vast crowds, not only of men,
but of women. The senate, being re-assembled, ordered
thanksgivings in all the temples, during five days, for the
glorious successes obtained by the consul Lucius &AElig;milius,
with sacrifices of the larger kinds of victims. They also
voted that the ships, which lay in the Tiber fit for sea, and
ready to sail for Macedon, in case the king had been able to
maintain the contest, should be hauled up, and placed in the
docks, and that the seamen belonging to them should be discharged,
after receiving a year&#8217;s pay; and, together with these,
all who had taken the military oath to the consul; that all the
soldiers in Corcyra and Brundusium, on the coast of the Hadriatic
and in the territory of Larinum, (for in all these places had
troops been cantoned, in order that the consul Licinius might,
if occasion required, take them over to reinforce his colleague,)
should be disbanded. The thanksgiving was fixed, by proclamation
in the assembly, for the fifth day before the ides of
October, and the five days following.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i3" name="i3"></a>3</span>
Two deputies, Caius Licinius Nerva and Publius Decius,
arriving from Illyria, brought intelligence that the army of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2118" id="Page_2118">Pg 2118</a></span>
the Illyrians was defeated, their king, Gentius, taken prisoner
and all Illyria reduced under the dominion of the Roman
people. On account of these services, under the conduct and
auspices of the pr&aelig;tor, Lucius Anicius, the senate voted a
supplication of three days&#8217; continuance, and it was accordingly
appointed, by proclamation, to be performed on the fourth
third, and second days before the ides of November. Some
writers tell us that the Rhodian ambassadors, who had not
yet been dismissed, were, when the news of the victory
was received, called before the senate in order to expose
their absurd arrogance. On this occasion, Agesipolis, their
principal, spoke to this effect: that &#8220;they had been sent by
the Rhodians to effect an accommodation between the Romans
and Perseus; because the war subsisting between them was
injurious and burdensome to all Greece, and expensive and
detrimental to the Romans themselves; but that fortune had
acted very kindly, since, by terminating the war after another
manner, it afforded them an opportunity of congratulating the
Romans on a glorious victory.&#8221; This was the discourse of
the Rhodians. The senate returned the following answer:
that &#8220;the Rhodians had sent that embassy, not through
anxiety for the interests of Greece, or for the expenses of the
Roman people, but merely from their wish to serve Perseus.
For, if their concern had been such as they pretended, they
should have sent ambassadors at the time when Perseus,
leading an army into Thessaly, had continued, for two years,
to besiege some of the cities of Greece, and to terrify others
with denunciations of vengeance. All this time not the least
mention of peace was made by the Rhodians; but when they
heard that the Romans had passed the defiles, and penetrated
into Macedon, and that Perseus was held enclosed by them,
then they sent an embassy, from no other motive whatever,
but a wish to rescue Perseus from the impending danger.&#8221;
With this answer the ambassadors were dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i4" name="i4"></a>4</span>
About the same time Marcus Marcellus, coming home
from Spain, where he had taken Marcolica, a city of note,
brought into the treasury ten pounds&#8217; weight of gold, and a
quantity of silver, amounting to a million of sesterces.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
While the consul, Paullus &AElig;milius, lay encamped at Sir&aelig;, in
Odomantice, as mentioned above, a letter from king Perseus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2119" id="Page_2119">Pg 2119</a></span>was brought to him by three ambassadors of mean appearance,
and it is reported that he, on looking at them, shed tears at
the uncertainty of the lot of man; because he who, a short
time before, not content with the kingdom of Macedon, had
invaded Dardania and Illyria, and had called out to his aid
the whole Bastarnian nation, now banished from his kingdom
after the loss of his army, was forced to take refuge in a little
island, where, as a suppliant, he was protected by the sanctity
of the place, not by any strength of his own. But when he
read the address, &#8220;King Perseus to the consul Paullus, greeting,&#8221;
the folly of a man, who seemed insensible to his condition,
banished every feeling of compassion; therefore,
although there were, in the remaining part of the letter,
entreaties ill suited to royalty, yet the embassy was dismissed
without an answer and without a letter. Perseus felt that he
must, now that he was conquered, forego the name of king,
and consequently sent another letter, inscribed simply with
his name, in which he made a request, and obtained it too,
that some persons should be sent to him, with whom he might
confer on the state and condition of his affairs. Three ambassadors
were accordingly despatched, Publius Lentulus, Aulus
Postumius Albinus, and Aulus Antonius; but nothing was
effected by this embassy, for Perseus clung with all the energy
of despair to the regal title, while Paullus insisted on an absolute
submission of himself, and every thing belonging to
him, to the honour and clemency of the Roman people.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i5" name="i5"></a>5</span>
Whilst these things are going on, the fleet of Cneius
Octavius put in at Samothrace. When he also, by presenting
immediate danger to Perseus&#8217;s view, was endeavouring at
one time by menaces, at another by hopes, to prevail on him
to surrender; in this design he was greatly assisted by a
circumstance which may have occurred either by accident or
design. Lucius Atilius, a distinguished young man, observing
that the people of Samothrace were met in a general assembly,
requested permission of the magistrate to address a few words
to them; which being granted, he said,&mdash;&#8220;People of Samothrace,
our good hosts; is the account which we have heard
true or false, that this island is sacred, and the entire soil holy
and inviolable?&#8221; They all agreed in asserting the supposed
sanctity of the place; whereupon he proceeded thus: &#8220;Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2120" id="Page_2120">Pg 2120</a></span>
then, has a murderer, stained with the blood of king Eumenes,
presumed to profane it? And though, previous to every sacrifice,
a proclamation forbids all who have not pure hands to
assist at the sacred rites, will you, nevertheless, suffer your
holy places to be polluted by an assassin who bears the mark
of blood on his person?&#8221; The story of king Eumenes having
been nearly murdered by Evander at Delphi, was now well
known by report through all the cities of Greece. The Samothracians,
therefore, besides the consideration of their being
themselves, as well as the temple and the whole island, in the
power of the Romans, were convinced that the censure
thrown on them was not unjust, and therefore sent Theondas,
their chief magistrate, whom they style king, to Perseus, to
acquaint him, that &#8220;Evander the Cretan was accused of
murder; that they had a mode of trial established among
them, by the practice of their ancestors, concerning such as
were charged with bringing impure hands into the consecrated
precincts of the temple. If Evander was confident that he
was innocent of the capital charge made against him, let him
come forth, and stand a trial; but, if he would not venture to
undergo an inquiry, let him free the temple from profanation,
and provide for his own safety.&#8221; Perseus, calling Evander
aside, advised him not on any account to stand a trial, because
he was no match for his accusers, either in the merits of the
cause, or in influence. He had secret apprehensions that
Evander, on being condemned, would expose him, as the instigator
of that abominable act. &#8220;What then remained,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but to die bravely?&#8221; Evander made, openly, no objection;
but telling the king that he chose to die by poison
rather than by the sword, took measures in secret for effecting
his escape. When this was told the king, fearing lest he
should direct the anger of the Samothracians against himself
as accessory to the escape of a guilty person, he ordered Evander
to be put to death. No sooner was this rash murder perpetrated,
than the idea immediately struck his mind that he
had now drawn on himself the whole of the guilt, which
before had affected Evander only; that the latter had wounded
Eumenes at Delphi, and he had slain Evander in Samothrace;
and thus the two most venerable sanctuaries in the world had,
through his means alone, been defiled with human blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2121" id="Page_2121">Pg 2121</a></span>
However, he avoided the imputation of this deed, by bribing
Theondas to tell the people that Evander had laid violent
hands on himself.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i6" name="i6"></a>6</span>
But by such an atrocious act, committed on his only remaining
friend, on one whose fidelity he had experienced on
so many trying occasions, and who, in return for not proving
a traitor, was himself betrayed, he alienated the feelings of
every one. All went over to the Romans as soon as they
could, and consequently obliged him, now left almost alone, to
adopt the design of flying. He applied to a Cretan, called Oroandes,
to whom the coast of Thrace was well known, since he
carried on traffic in that country, to take him on board his
vessel, and convey him to Cotys. At one of the promontories
of Samothrace, is the harbour of Demetrium; there the vessel
lay. About sun-set every thing necessary for the voyage was
carried thither, together with as much money as could be
transported with secrecy; and at midnight, the king himself,
with three persons, who were privy to his flight, going out
through a back door into a garden near his chamber, and
having, with much difficulty, climbed over the wall, went
down to the shore. Oroandes had set sail, at the dusk of the
evening, the very moment the money arrived, and was now
steering for Crete. Perseus, after he could not find the ship
in the harbour, wandered about for a long time on the coast,
but at last, fearing the approach of day, and not daring to return
to his lodging, he hid himself in a dark corner at one side
of the temple. The royal pages was the name given among the
Macedonians to a band of the children of the leading noblemen,
who were selected to wait on the king: this band had accompanied
Perseus in his flight, and did not even now desert him,
until a proclamation was made by the herald of Cneius Octavius,
that, &#8220;if the royal pages, and other Macedonians, then
in Samothrace, would come over to the Romans, they should
have impunity, liberty, and all their property, both what they
had in the island, and what they had left in Macedon.&#8221; On
this notice they all passed over to the Romans, and gave in
their names to Caius Postumius, a military tribune. Ion of
Thessalonica delivered up to Octavius the king&#8217;s younger
children also; nor was any one now left with Perseus, except
Philip, his eldest son. Then, after uttering many execrations
against fortune, and the gods to whom the temple belonged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2122" id="Page_2122">Pg 2122</a></span>
for not affording aid to a suppliant, he surrendered himself
and his son to Octavius, who gave orders to put him on board
the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s ship; the remainder of his money was put on
board the same ship; and the fleet immediately returned to
Amphipolis. Thence Octavius sent the king into the camp
to the consul, having previously sent forward a letter to inform
him that he was a prisoner, and on the road thither.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i7" name="i7"></a>7</span>
Paullus, considering this a second victory, as it really
was, offered sacrifices on receiving the intelligence; then, calling
a council, and reading to them the pr&aelig;tor&#8217;s letter, he sent
Quintus &AElig;lius Tubero to meet the king; the rest he desired
to remain assembled in the pr&aelig;torium. Never, on any other
occasion, did so great a multitude gather about a spectacle.
In the time of their fathers, king Syphax had been made
prisoner, and brought into the Roman camp; but, besides that
he could not be compared with Perseus, either in respect of
his own reputation or that of his country, he was at the time
merely a subordinate party in the Carthaginian war, as Gentius
was in the Macedonian. Whereas Perseus was the
principal in this war; and was not only highly conspicuous
through his own personal renown, and that of his father,
grandfather, and other relations in blood and extraction, but
of these, two shone with unparalleled lustre,&mdash;Philip, and
Alexander the Great, who made the empire of the Macedonians
the first in the world. Perseus came into the camp, dressed
in mourning, unattended by any of his countrymen, except
his own son, who being a sharer in the calamity, made him
more wretched. He could not advance on account of the
number of persons that had collected to see him, until the
lictors were sent by the consul, and they, after clearing the
way, opened a passage to the pr&aelig;torium. The consul arose to
do him honour, but ordered the rest to keep their seats, and,
advancing a little, held out his right hand to the king, on his
entrance; and raised him up when he endeavoured to throw
himself at his feet: nor would he suffer him to embrace his
knees, but led him into the tent, and desired him to sit on the
side opposite to the officers assembled in council.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i8" name="i8"></a>8</span>
The first question asked Perseus was, &#8220;by what injuries
had he been compelled to enter into a war against the Roman
people with such violent animosity, and to bring himself and
his kingdom to the extremity of danger?&#8221; While all expected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2123" id="Page_2123">Pg 2123</a></span>
his answer, fixing his eyes on the ground, he wept a long
time in silence. The consul, again addressing him, said, &#8220;If
you had succeeded to the government in early youth, I should
have wondered less at your not being sensible of the great
importance of the friendship, or enmity, of the Roman people:
but that was not the case, as you bore a part in the war which
your father waged with us, and, afterwards, must have remembered
the peace which we observed towards him with the
strictest sincerity. What then was your design in preferring
war to peace, with those, whose power in war, and whose good
faith in peace, you had so fully experienced?&#8221; Neither questions
nor reproaches could draw an answer from him: on which the
consul added, &#8220;Howsoever these things may have occurred,
whether through the frailty of mankind, or accident, or necessity,
be of good spirits. The clemency of the Roman people,
displayed in the distress of numerous kings and nations, affords
you not only hope, but almost perfect confidence of safety.&#8221;
This he said in the Greek language to Perseus; and then,
turning to his own people, he said, in the Latin tongue, &#8220;You
observe this striking instance of the instability of human
affairs. To you, young men, principally, I address the observation.
In the hour of prosperity, therefore, we ought to
adopt against no man measures dictated by either pride or
violence, nor confide implicitly in present advantages; since
we know not what the evening may produce. He is really a
man, whose spirit neither prosperity can elate by success, nor
adversity break by misfortune.&#8221; On the dismissal of the council,
the charge of guarding the king is given to Quintus &AElig;lius.
Perseus was invited to dine that day with the consul, and
every other honour, which could be shown him under existing
circumstances, was paid to him.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i9" name="i9"></a>9</span>
The troops were immediately sent off to their winter
cantonments. Amphipolis furnished the greater part with
quarters, and the towns in that neighbourhood received the
rest. Thus ended the war between the Romans and Perseus,
which had lasted, without intermission, four years; and thus
ended a kingdom, long renowned through a great part of
Europe, and throughout all Asia. From Caranus, who was
their first king, they reckoned Perseus the fortieth. Perseus
came to the crown in the consulate of Quintus Fulvius and
Lucius Manlius, received the title of king from the senate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2124" id="Page_2124">Pg 2124</a></span>
that of Marcus Junius and Aulus Manlius, and reigned eleven
years. The Macedonians were little known by fame until the
reign of Philip, son of Amyntas; although the empire began
to increase in his time, and through his agency, still it was confined
within the limits of Europe, extending over all Greece
with a part of Thrace, and Illyria. Afterwards the power
of Macedon poured down like a deluge on Asia, and in the
course of the thirteen years of the reign of Alexander, reduced
under its dominion that almost immense tract which
had constituted the empire of the Persians. Hence it overspread
the Arabias and India, as far as where the Red Sea
forms the utmost boundary of the earth. At that time their
empire and name were the first in the world; but on the death
of Alexander, it was torn asunder into a number of kingdoms,
whilst his successors, in the general scramble for power, dismembered
it by their struggles. From the time of its highest
elevation to this its final downfall, it stood one hundred and
fifty years.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i10" name="i10"></a>10</span>
When the news of the victory, obtained by the Romans,
was carried into Asia, Antenor, who lay with a fleet of small
vessels at Phan&aelig;, sailed over to Cassandrea. Caius Popilius,
who staid at Delos to protect the ships bound to Macedon,
learning that the war there was at an end, and that the enemy&#8217;s
fleet had left its station, sent home the Athenian squadron,
and proceeded on his voyage for Egypt, to finish the business
of the embassy with which he was charged, in order that he
might meet Antiochus before he should approach the walls of
Alexandria. When the ambassadors, after sailing along the
coast of Asia, arrived at Loryma, a port somewhat more than
twenty miles from Rhodes, and just opposite to that city, some
of the principal Rhodians (for the news of the victory had
by this time reached them too) met them, and requested them
&#8220;to sail over to their city; that it was of the utmost consequence
to the character and safety of the Rhodian state that they
should, in person, inform themselves of what had been done,
and what was then passing at Rhodes; so as to carry to Rome
intelligence, founded on their own knowledge, and not on
vague reports.&#8221; After refusing for a long time, they were at
length prevailed on to submit to a short delay of their voyage,
for the sake of the safety of an allied city. When they came
to Rhodes, the same persons, by urgent entreaties, persuaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2125" id="Page_2125">Pg 2125</a></span>
them to come into a general assembly. The arrival of the
ambassadors rather heightened, than allayed, the fears of the
public. For Popilius enumerated all the hostile expressions
and actions, both of the community and of individuals, during
the war: and, being naturally of an austere temper, he magnified
the atrociousness of the matters which he mentioned,
by the sternness of his countenance, and the harshness of his
tone of voice; so that, as he had no cause of personal quarrel
with their state, people judged from the severity of one Roman
senator, what was the feeling of the whole senate towards
them. The speech of Caius Decimius was more moderate;
for he said, &#8220;that in most of the particulars mentioned by
Popilius, the blame lay, not on the nation, but on a few incendiary
ringleaders of the populace, who, employing their tongues
for hire, procured the passing of several decrees, full of flattery
towards the king; and had sent those embassies, at which the
Rhodians should always feel not less shame than grief; all
which proceedings, however, if the people were disposed to
act properly, would fall on the heads of the guilty.&#8221; He was
heard with great satisfaction; not only because he extenuated
the offences of the community, but because he threw the
whole blame on the authors of their misconduct. When,
therefore, their own magistrates spoke in answer to the Romans,
the speech of those who endeavoured to exculpate them,
in some measure, from the charges advanced by Popilius,
was not so pleasing to them as the advice of those who concurred
with the opinion of Decimius, in the necessity of
giving up the principal instigators to atone for their crime.
A decree was therefore immediately passed, that all who
should be convicted of having, in any instance, spoken or
acted in favour of Perseus, against the Romans, should be
condemned to die. Several of those concerned had left the
city on the arrival of the Romans: others put an end to their
own lives. The ambassadors staid only five days at Rhodes,
and then proceeded to Alexandria. Nor were the trials instituted,
pursuant to the decree passed in their presence, carried
on at Rhodes with less activity; and this perseverance of the
Rhodians, in the execution of that business, was entirely
owing to the mild behaviour of Decimius.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i11" name="i11"></a>11</span>
Whilst these events were going on, Antiochus, after a
fruitless attempt on the walls of Alexandria, had retired:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2126" id="Page_2126">Pg 2126</a></span>
and being now master of all the rest of Egypt, he left, at
Memphis, the elder Ptolemy, whose restoration to the throne
was the pretended object of his armament, though, in reality,
he meant to attack him, as soon as he should have vanquished
his competitors; and then he led back his army into Syria.
Ptolemy, who was not ignorant of his intention, conceived
hopes, that, while he held his younger brother under terror,
and in dread of a siege, he might be received into Alexandria,
provided his sister favoured the design, and his brother&#8217;s
friends did not oppose it. Accordingly, he never ceased
sending proposals to his sister first, and his brother and his
friends afterwards, until he effected an accommodation with
them. His suspicions of Antiochus were awakened by this
circumstance, that, when he gave him possession of the rest of
Egypt, he left a strong garrison in Pelusium: a plain proof
that he kept that key of Egypt in his hands, in order that he
might be able, whenever he pleased, to introduce an army
again into the country; and he foresaw, that the final issue of
a civil war with his brother must be, that the conqueror,
thoroughly weakened by the contest, would be utterly unable
to contend with Antiochus. In these prudent observations of
the elder brother, the younger, and those about him, concurred;
while their sister greatly promoted the negotiation, both
by her advice and entreaties. Accordingly, peace being made
with the approbation of all, the elder Ptolemy was received
into Alexandria, without any opposition even from the
populace; who, during the war, had been severely distressed
by a general scarcity, not only in consequence of the siege,
but from receiving no provisions from the rest of Egypt
after the enemy had retired from the walls. Although it was
reasonable to suppose that Antiochus would be rejoiced at
these events, if he had really marched his army into Egypt
for the purpose of reinstating Ptolemy on the throne,&mdash;(the
plausible pretext which he had professed to all the states of
Asia and Greece, in his answers to their embassies, and in
the letters that he wrote,)&mdash;yet he was so highly offended, that
he prepared to make war on the two brothers, with much
greater acrimony and fury of resentment than he had shown
against the one. He instantly sent his fleet to Cyprus; and,
as soon as the spring appeared, he directed his route towards
Egypt at the head of his army, and advanced into C&#339;le-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2127" id="Page_2127">Pg 2127</a></span>syria.
Near Rhinocolura he was met by ambassadors from
Ptolemy, who gave him thanks, because through his assistance
he had recovered the throne of his fathers; and requested
him to secure to him the enjoyment of the benefit, which
he had himself conferred; and rather to signify what he
wished to be done, than from an ally to become an enemy, and
proceed by force of arms. To this he answered, that &#8220;he
would neither recall his fleet, nor stop the march of his army,
on any other conditions than the cession of all Cyprus and the
city of Pelusium, together with the lands adjoining the Pelusian
mouth of the Nile;&#8221; and he even named a particular day,
on or before which he expected to receive an answer that
these demands were complied with.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i12" name="i12"></a>12</span>
When the time fixed for the suspension of hostilities
had elapsed, <i>Antiochus ordered the commanders of his fleet</i> to
sail up the mouth of the Nile to Pelusium, while <i>he himself
entered Egypt</i>, through the deserts of Arabia. <i>He was
amicably received by the people</i> about Memphis, as he was,
afterwards, by the rest of the Egyptians; some being led by
inclination, others by fear; and he proceeded thus, by short
marches, down to Alexandria. The Roman ambassadors met
him after crossing the river at Eleusine, four miles from that
city. On their approach he saluted them, and held out his
right hand to Popilius; but Popilius put into his hand a
written tablet, containing the decree of the senate, and desired
him first to peruse that. On perusing it, he said, that he,
after calling his friends together, would consult on what was
to be done; on which Popilius, with the usual asperity of his
disposition, drew a line round the king, with a wand which
he held in his hand, and said, &#8220;Before you go out of that
circle, give me an answer to report to the senate.&#8221; Astonished
at such a peremptory injunction, the king hesitated for some
time; but at last replied, &#8220;I will do as the senate directs.&#8221;
Popilius then thought proper to stretch out his right hand to
him; as to a friend and ally. Antiochus having retired out
of Egypt, on the day appointed, the ambassadors, after confirming
by their influence the reconciliations between the brothers,
as concord was far from being established among them,
sailed to Cyprus: from which they sent home the ships of
Antiochus, which had fought and defeated an Egyptian fleet.
This embassy attracted a great share of respect from all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2128" id="Page_2128">Pg 2128</a></span>
nations; because it had manifestly rescued Egypt out of the
hands of the Syrian, when he had it within his grasp, and restored
to the race of Ptolemy the kingdom of their forefathers
While one of the consuls of this year distinguished his administration
by a glorious victory, the reputation of the other
was thrown into the shade, because he had no opportunity of
displaying his talents. When, in the beginning of his administration,
he had appointed his troops to assemble, he
entered the consecrated place without due auspices; and the
augurs, on the matter being laid before them, pronounced the
appointment improper. Going into Gaul, he lay encamped
near the long plains, at the foot of the mountains Sicimina and
Papirus, and passed the winter in the same country with the
troops of the Latin allies. The Roman legions staid all the
while in the city, because the day had been irregularly appointed
for the meeting of the soldiers. The pr&aelig;tors went
to their several provinces, except Caius Papirius Carbo, to
whose lot Sardinia had fallen; the senate having commanded
him to administer justice, at Rome, between natives and
foreigners; a duty to which he had been already named.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i13" name="i13"></a>13</span>
Popilius, with his colleagues in the embassy to Antiochus,
returned to Rome, and gave information, that all disputes
between the kings had terminated, and that the army
had marched out of Egypt into Syria. Soon after, ambassadors
arrived from the kings themselves. Those of Antiochus
represented, that &#8220;their king had considered a peace, which
was agreeable to the senate, as preferable to a victory, how
complete soever, and had, accordingly, obeyed the order of the
Roman ambassadors, as implicitly as if it had been a mandate
of the gods.&#8221; They then offered his congratulations on their
victory, &#8220;to which,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the king would have contributed
with his utmost power, if any commands to that
effect had been given him.&#8221; The ambassadors of Ptolemy, in
the joint names of that prince and Cleopatra, presented their
thanks, acknowledging that &#8220;they were more indebted to the
senate and people of Rome than to their own parents, more
than to the immortal gods; since through their intervention
they had been relieved from a most distressing siege, and had
recovered the kingdom of their fathers, when it was almost
entirely lost.&#8221; The answer given by the senate was that
&#8220;Antiochus had acted rightly and properly, in complying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2129" id="Page_2129">Pg 2129</a></span>
with the demand of their ambassadors; and that his conduct
was pleasing to the senate and people of Rome.&#8221; To Ptolemy
and Cleopatra, king and queen of Egypt, they answered, that
&#8220;the senate rejoiced very much, that any benefit or advantage
had accrued to the Egyptian monarchs, through their instrumentality;
and would take care, that they should always
have reason to consider, that the strongest bulwark of their
kingdom lay in the protection of the Roman people.&#8221; Caius
Papirius, the pr&aelig;tor, was commissioned to send the usual
presents to the ambassadors. A letter now arrived from
Macedon, which doubled the public joy, as it brought information
that &#8220;king Perseus was in the hands of the consul.&#8221;
After the ambassadors were dismissed, a controversy between
deputies from Pisa and others from Luna came on; the
former, complaining that they were dispossessed of their lands
by the Roman colonists; while the latter insisted that the
lands in question had been marked out to them by the
triumvirs. The senate sent five commissioners to examine
and fix the boundaries, Quintus Fabius Buteo, Publius Cornelius
Blasio, Tiberius Sempronius Musca, Lucius N&aelig;vius
Balbus, and Caius Apuleius Saturninus. A joint embassy
from the three brothers, Eumenes, Attalus, and Athen&aelig;us,
came with congratulations on the victory; and Masgaba, son
of king Masinissa, having landed at Puteoli, Lucius Manlius,
the qu&aelig;stor, was immediately despatched with money to meet
him, and conduct him to Rome at the public expense. An
audience of the senate was immediately given him on his arrival.
This young prince spoke in such a manner that he
made services, which were meritorious in themselves, still
more gratifying. He recounted what numbers of foot and
horse, how many elephants, and what quantities of corn his
father had sent into Macedon in aid of the Romans during the
last four years. &#8220;But there were two things,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
made him blush; one, the senate having sent by their ambassadors
a request, instead of an order, to furnish necessaries
for their army; the other, their having sent money in payment
for the corn. Masinissa well remembered that the kingdom
which he held had been acquired, and increased, and multiplied
by the Roman people; and contenting himself with the
management of it, acknowledged the right and sovereignty
to be vested in those who granted it to him. It was just,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2130" id="Page_2130">Pg 2130</a></span>
therefore, to take, and not to ask from him nor purchase,
any of the produce of lands made over by themselves. Whatever
remained, after supplying the Roman people, would be
fully sufficient for Masinissa.&#8221; That with these instructions he
parted with his father; but he was afterwards overtaken by some
horsemen, who announced to him the conquest of Macedon,
with directions to congratulate the senate, and acquaint them
that his father felt so much joy at that circumstance, that he
wished to come to Rome, and in the Capitol to offer thanks to
Jupiter supremely good and great. He requested, therefore,
that if it were not disagreeable, the senate would give him.
permission to do so.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i14" name="i14"></a>14</span>
Masgaba was answered, that &#8220;his father, Masinissa,
acted as became a prince of a benevolent and grateful disposition;
to such a degree that, by acknowledging the kindness
of his friends, he added value and dignity to it. The Roman
people had been assisted by him in the Carthaginian war with
exertions at once faithful and brave; by the favour of the
Roman people he had obtained his kingdom, and had afterwards,
in the successive wars with the three kings, discharged
with his usual readiness every duty. That it was not surprising,
that a king who had so intimately blended his own
interests, and those of his kingdom, with the interests of the
Romans, should be delighted at the victory of the Roman
people. That he should return thanks to the immortal gods
for the victory of the Roman people, before the tutelary deities
of his family; that his son could return thanks in his stead at
Rome; as he had already said enough in the way of congratulation,
both in his own name and in his father&#8217;s. But that
the senate were of opinion, that his leaving his own kingdom,
and going out of Africa, besides being inconvenient to himself,
was detrimental to the Roman people.&#8221; On Masgaba
making a request that Hanno, son of Hamilcar, <i>might be
brought to Rome as a</i> hostage in the place <i>of some other, the
senate replied, that they could not reasonably require hostages
from the Carthaginians, at the choice of any other person</i>.
The qu&aelig;stor was ordered, by a vote of the senate, to purchase
presents for the young prince to the value of one hundred
pounds&#8217; weight of silver, to accompany him to Puteoli, to defray
all his expenses while he staid in Italy, and to hire two
ships to carry him and the retinue of the king to Africa;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2131" id="Page_2131">Pg 2131</a></span>
clothes were given to every one of his attendants, both freemen
and slaves. Soon after this a letter was brought concerning
Masinissa&#8217;s other son, Misagenes, stating that, after the
conquest of Perseus, he was sent by Lucius Paullus, with his
horsemen, to Africa; and that while he was on his voyage in
the Adriatic Sea, his fleet was dispersed, and himself, in a bad
state of health, driven into Brundusium with only three ships.
Lucius Stertinius, the qu&aelig;stor, was sent to him to Brundusium,
with presents of the same kind as those given to his brother
at Rome, and he was ordered to provide lodgings for the
prince and his retinue, and <i>every thing necessary for his health
and convenience; and that the expenses of himself and his entire
retinue should be paid liberally; that he should look out
for ships by which the prince might pass over into Africa with
ease and safety. The qu&aelig;stor was ordered to give to each of
the horsemen a pound of silver, and five hundred sesterces.
The assemblies, for the election of consuls for the ensuing year,
were held by Caius Licinius the consul. Quintus &AElig;lius
P&aelig;tus, Marcus Junius Pennus, were appointed consuls. Then
Quintus Cassius Longinus, Manius Juventius Thalna, Tiberius
Claudius Nero, Aulus Manlius Torquatus, Cneius
Fulvius Gillo, C. Licinius Nerva, were made pr&aelig;tors. In the
same year the censors, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and
Caius Claudius Pulcher, at length united in passing a decree
on a matter, which had been for a long time discussed among
themselves in different disputes. Gracchus, when the freed-men,
after being repeatedly confined within the four city
tribes, had once more spread themselves through them all,
wished to pluck up by the root the evil which was always sending
fresh shoots, and to exclude from enrolment all who had
ever been slaves. Claudius struggled energetically against
him, and made frequent references to the institutions of their
ancestors, who had often tried to restrain the freed-men, but
never to totally exclude them from the rights of citizens.
He said that some relaxation of the former strictness had been
conceded even by the censors, Caius Flaminius and Lucius
&AElig;milius. And indeed, although even at that time those
dregs of the people had spread themselves through all the
tribes, and it appeared requisite to reduce them again within
what might be considered their original settlement, still at
the time some important concessions were made to several of
that rank.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2132" id="Page_2132">Pg 2132</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i15" name="i15"></a>15</span>
<i>For by those censors</i> the freed-men were enrolled in the
four city tribes, excepting such as had a son more than five
years old, who was their own offspring; all these the censors
ordered to be surveyed in the tribe wherein they had been
surveyed within the last five years; and such as had a farm,
or farms, in the country, exceeding in value thirty thousand
sesterces,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> were allowed the privilege of being included in the
country tribes. Though this reservation was made in their
favour, yet Claudius still insisted, that &#8220;a censor could not,
without an order of the people, take away from any man, and
much less from a whole class of men, the right of suffrage.
For though he can remove a man from his tribe, which is nothing
more than ordering him to change it, yet he cannot,
therefore, remove him out of all the thirty-five tribes; which
would be to strip him of the rights of a citizen, and of liberty;
not to fix where he should be surveyed, but to exclude him
from the survey.&#8221; These points were discussed by the censors,
who at last came to this compromise: that out of the
four city tribes, they should openly, in the court of the temple
of Liberty, select one by lot, in which they should include
all those who had ever been in servitude. The lot fell on the
&AElig;squiline tribe; on which Tiberius Gracchus published an
order, that all sons of freed-men should be surveyed in that
tribe. This proceeding gained the censors great honour with
the senate, who gave thanks to Sempronius for his perseverance
in so good a design, and also to Claudius for not obstructing
it. Greater numbers were expelled from the senate, and
ordered to sell their horses, by them than by their predecessors.
They both concurred in removing from their tribes
and disfranchising the same persons, in every instance; nor
did one of them remove any mark of disgrace inflicted by the
other. They petitioned that, according to custom, the year
and half&#8217;s time allowed for enforcing the repairs of buildings,
and for approving the execution of works contracted for,
should be prolonged; but Cneius Tremellius, a tribune, protested
against it, because he had not been chosen into the
senate. This year Caius Cicereius dedicated a temple to
Juno Monita on the Alban mount, five years after he had
vowed it; and Lucius Postumius Albinus was inaugurated
flamen of Mars.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i16" name="i16"></a>16</span>
The consuls, Quintius &AElig;lius and Marcus Junius, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2133" id="Page_2133">Pg 2133</a></span>
proposed the business of distributing, the provinces, the
senate decreed that Spain, which during the Macedonian war
had been but one province, should be again formed into two;
and that the present governors, Lucius Paullus and Lucius
Anicius, should continue in the government of Macedonia and
Illyria, until, with the concurrence of commissioners, they
should adjust the affairs of those countries disordered by the
war, and reduce them to a form of government different from
the regal. The provinces assigned to the consuls were Pis&aelig;
and Gaul, with two legions to each, containing separately five
thousand two hundred foot and four hundred horse. The lots
of the pr&aelig;tors were as follows: the city jurisdiction fell to Quintus
Cassius; the foreign, to Manius Juventius Thalna; Sicily,
to Tiberius Claudius Nero; Hither Spain, to Cneius Fulvius;
and to Caius Licinius Nerva, Farther Spain. Sardinia had fallen
to Aulus Manlius Torquatus, but he could not proceed thither,
being detained by a decree of the senate, to preside at trials
of capital offences. The senate was then consulted concerning
prodigies which were reported: the temple of the tutelar deities,
on the Velian hill, had been struck by lightning; and two
gates, and a large part of the wall, in the town of Minervium.
At Anagnia, a shower of earth had fallen; and, at Lanuvium,
a blazing torch was seen in the sky. Marcus Valerius, a
Roman citizen, reported, that at Calatia, on the public lands,
blood had flowed from his hearth, during three days and two
nights. On account of this last occurrence in particular, the
decemvirs were directed to consult the books; on which they
ordered a general supplication for one day, and sacrificed in
the forum fifty goats. On account of the other prodigies, there
was a supplication for another day, with sacrifices of the larger
victims, and the city was purified. Then, with reference to the
gratitude due to the immortal gods, the senate decreed, that,
&#8220;forasmuch as their enemies were subdued, and the kings
Perseus and Gentius, with Macedon and Illyria, were in the
power of the Roman people, whatever offerings were made in
all the temples by Appius Claudius and Marcus Sempronius,
the consuls, on occasion of the conquest of king Antiochus,
offerings of the same value should then be made, and that
Quintus Cassius and Manius Juventius, the pr&aelig;tors, should
superintend them.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i17" name="i17"></a>17</span>
They then constituted commissioners, by whose advice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2134" id="Page_2134">Pg 2134</a></span>
the generals, Lucius Paullus and Lucius Anicius, were to
regulate the affairs of their provinces; ten for Macedon, and
five for Illyria. Those nominated for Macedon were, Aulus
Postumius Luscus, Caius Claudius, both of whom had been
censors, Caius Licinius Crassus, the colleague of Paullus in
the consulship; he then held the province of Gaul, as he
had the command continued to him. To these, who were of
consular rank, the senate added Cneius Domitius &AElig;nobarbus,
Servius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Junius, Caius Antistius
Labeo, Titus Numisius Tarquiniensis, and Aulus Terentius
Varro. The following were nominated for Illyria: Publius
&AElig;lius Ligus, a man of consular rank, Caius Cicereius, Cneius
B&aelig;bius Tamphilus, (he had been pr&aelig;tor the last year, as had
Cicereius many years before,) Publius Terentius Tuscivicanus,
and Publius Manilius. The consuls were then advised by the
senate, that, as one of them must go into Gaul, in the room
of Caius Licinius, who was appointed a commissioner, they
should, as soon as possible, either settle their provinces between
themselves, or cast lots, as might be agreeable to them. They
chose to cast lots; when Pis&aelig; fell to Marcus Junius, (who
was ordered to introduce to the senate the embassies that
came to Rome from all quarters, with congratulations before
he went to his province,) and Gaul to Quintus &AElig;lius.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i18" name="i18"></a>18</span>
But although men of such characters were sent on the
commission, that confident hopes might be entertained that
the generals, influenced by their counsel, would determine on
nothing derogatory either to the clemency or dignity of the
Roman people, yet the heads of a plan of settlement were
considered in the senate, that the said commissioners might
carry, from Rome to the generals, an outline of the entire
plan. First, it was determined, that &#8220;the Macedonians and
Illyrians should be free; in order to demonstrate to all the
world that the arms of the Roman people did not bring slavery
to the free, but freedom to slaves, and that the nations which
already enjoyed freedom, should be convinced that it would
be safe and permanent under the protection of the <i>Roman
people</i>; and that such nations as lived under regal government
should be convinced that their princes, under awe of the
Roman people, would be, at present, more just and mild;
and that, should war break out at any time between their
kings and the Roman people, the issue would bring victory to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2135" id="Page_2135">Pg 2135</a></span>
the latter, and liberty to themselves. It was also provided,
that the farming both of the Macedonian mines, which produced
a very large profit, and that of crown lands, should be
abolished; as business of this kind could not be managed without
the intervention of revenue farmers; and wherever a tax-contractor
was employed, either the rights of the people were a
nonentity, or the freedom of the allies destroyed. Nor could the
Macedonians themselves conduct such affairs; for while they
afforded the managers opportunities of acquiring plunder for
themselves, there never would be wanting causes of disputes
and seditions. It was further determined, that there should be
a general council of the nation; lest the perverseness of the
populace might, some time or other, convert into pestilent
licentiousness the liberty granted by the senate with a wholesome
degree of moderation: but that Macedonia should be
divided into four districts, each of which should have a council
of its own; and that they should pay to the Roman people
half the tribute which they used formerly to pay to their
kings.&#8221; Similar instructions were given respecting Illyria.
Other particulars were left to the generals and commissioners;
whose investigation of matters on the spot would enable them
to form more accurate plans.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i19" name="i19"></a>19</span>
Among the many embassies from kings, nations, and
states, Attalus, the brother of Eumenes, attracted the general
attention in a very particular manner; for he was received by
those who had served along with him in the late war, with
even greater demonstration of kindness than if Eumenes had
come in person. Two reasons, both, apparently, highly honourable,
had induced him to come; one to offer congratulations,
which were quite proper, in the case of a victory to which he
himself had contributed; the other to complain of disturbances
raised by the Gauls, and of a defeat received, by which his
brother&#8217;s kingdom was endangered. But he had, also, secret
hopes of honours and rewards from the senate, which he
could scarcely receive without infringing on his duty to his
brother. There were among the Romans some evil advisers,
who were working on his ambition by promises. They told
him, that &#8220;the general opinion concerning Attalus and Eumenes
was, that one was a steady friend to the Romans, and
that the other was not a faithful ally either to them or to
Perseus. That it was not easy to determine whether the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2136" id="Page_2136">Pg 2136</a></span>
requests that he might make for himself, or those against his
brother, were more likely to be obtained from the senate;
so entirely were all disposed to gratify the one, and to grant
nothing to the other.&#8221; As the event proved, Attalus was one
of those who would have coveted all that hope can promise to
itself, had not the prudent admonitions of one friend put a
curb on those passions, which were growing wanton through
prosperity. He had, in his retinue, a physician, called Stratius
sent to Rome by Eumenes, who distrusted Attalus, for the
purpose of watching over his conduct, and giving him
faithful advice, if he should perceive him swerve from his
allegiance. This man, although he had to address ears already
prepossessed, and a mind already biassed, yet, by addressing
him at judiciously selected times, restored the thing to its
proper state, even after it had become almost desperate. He
said that &#8220;different kingdoms grew into power by different
means: that their kingdom being lately formed, and unsupported
by any long-established strength, was upheld solely by the
concord of the brothers; for, while one bore the title and the
ornament which distinguishes the head of a sovereign, each
of the brothers was considered as a king. As to Attalus, in
particular, being the next in years, was there any man who
did not consider him as king? and that, not only because they
perceived his present power to be great, but because there
was not a doubt but he must ascend the throne, in a very short
time, in consequence of the age and infirmity of Eumenes,
who had no legitimate issue&#8221; (for he had not at this time
acknowledged the son who afterwards reigned). &#8220;To what
purpose, then, employ violence, to attain what must come to
him presently without any exertions on his part? Besides, a
new storm had fallen on the kingdom, from the insurrection
of the Gauls, which could scarcely be resisted by the most
perfect harmony and union of the brothers. But if to a
foreign war domestic dissensions were added, the evil could
not be checked; nor would he effect any thing else than preventing
his brother from dying on the throne, and depriving
himself of the hope of ascending it. If both modes of acting
were honourable,&mdash;either to preserve the kingdom for his
brother, or to take it from him,&mdash;yet the honour that would
result to him from the preservation of the kingdom, since it
was united to brotherly love, would be the greater. The latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2137" id="Page_2137">Pg 2137</a></span>
indeed, would be detestable, and bordering nearly on parricide;
what room, then, could there be for deliberation? For,
whether did he mean to demand a share of the kingdom, or
to seize the whole? If he would demand a share, then both, by
the separation of their strength, would be rendered feeble, and
exposed to injuries of every kind; if the whole, would he then
require his elder brother, reduced to a private station, at his
time of life and labouring under such bodily infirmities, to live
in exile, and die in such a wretched state. For, not to mention
the catastrophes of undutiful brothers recorded in stories,
the fate of Perseus seemed a striking instance, who, prostrated
at the feet of a victorious enemy, laid down, in the temple of the
Samothracians, before the gods, who, as it were, demanded
satisfaction for his crimes, the crown which he had seized
after the death of his brother. &#8220;Those very men,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;who not through friendship for him, but enmity to Eumenes,
had instigated him to the adoption of such measures, would
praise his affection and firmness, if he preserved to the last
his allegiance to his brother.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i20" name="i20"></a>20</span>
These arguments prevailed in the mind of Attalus.
Therefore, on being introduced to the senate, he congratulated
them on their success, and made mention of his own services
during the war, and those of his brother, whatever he had
performed; of the defection of the Gauls, which had lately
happened, and which had caused violent commotions; and he
entreated that they should send ambassadors to those people,
by whose authority they should be summoned to desist. After
delivering these messages respecting the general interest of
the state, he requested a grant of &AElig;nus and Maronea to himself.
Having thus disappointed the hopes of those who expected
that he, after arraigning his brother&#8217;s conduct, would
solicit a partition of the kingdom, he retired from the senate-house.
Seldom on other occasions was either a king or private
person heard with such a degree of favour and approbation
by all; during his stay he received presents and honours
of every description, and they treated him similarly at his
departure. Of the many embassies which came from Greece
and Asia, that of the Rhodians engaged the greatest share of
the public attention. At first they appeared in white, the
colour which was most becoming to persons congratulating
others, for had they worn mourning, they might seem to be lamenting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2138" id="Page_2138">Pg 2138</a></span>
the misfortunes of Perseus. Afterwards the senate
being consulted by the consul, Marcus Junius, (the ambassadors
standing in the Comitium,) whether they should grant
them lodgings, entertainments, and an audience of the senate
they voted that no duty of hospitality was due to them.
When the consul came out of the senate-house, after the Rhodians
had told him that they were come to congratulate the Romans
on their late success, and to clear their state of the charges
made against it, and requested an audience of the senate, he
returned this answer, that &#8220;it was the custom of the Romans
both to grant audience in their senate, and to perform
other acts of kindness and hospitality to their friends and
allies; but that the Rhodians had not deserved in that war to
be ranked in the number of friends or allies.&#8221; On hearing
this, they all prostrated themselves on the ground, beseeching
the consul and all present not to think it right that new and
false imputations should operate more powerfully to their prejudice,
than their long course of services, which they had
themselves witnessed. They immediately assumed a mourning
dress, and going round to the houses of the principal men,
supplicated with prayers and tears that their cause might be
heard before they were condemned.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i21" name="i21"></a>21</span>
Marcus Juventius Thalna, the pr&aelig;tor who had the
jurisdiction between natives and foreigners, stimulated the
public resentment against the Rhodians, and promulgated a
bill, that &#8220;war should be declared against the Rhodians, and
that the people should choose one of the magistrates of the
present year, who should be sent with a fleet to carry on that
war;&#8221; with the hope that he himself should be the person
chosen. Two of the plebeian tribunes, Marcus Antonius and
Marcus Pomponius, opposed this proceeding. But the pr&aelig;tor,
on his part, commenced the business in an unprecedented and
pernicious manner; for without first consulting the senate,
and without acquainting the consuls, of his own sole judgment
he proposed to the people the question, &#8220;was it their will and
order that war should be declared against the Rhodians?&#8221;
whereas, ever until then, the senate was first consulted concerning
the war, and then the business was laid before the
people. On the other side, the plebeian tribunes <i>opposed this
proceeding</i>; although it was a received rule that no tribune
should protest against a proposal, until opportunity was given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2139" id="Page_2139">Pg 2139</a></span>
to private citizens to argue for and against it; in consequence
of which it had often happened that some, who had avowed no
intention of protesting, having discovered defects in the law
from the discourses of those who opposed it, on that account
did protest; and some who came avowedly to protest, abstained
from it, being convinced by the arguments of those who spoke
in favour of the law. On this occasion the pr&aelig;tor and tribunes
vied with each other in doing every thing out of time.
<i>While the tribunes blamed the hasty proceeding of the pr&aelig;tor,
they imitated the example by protesting before their time.
The only pretence they alleged for it was, the necessity for
adjourning the entire deliberation concerning the Rhodians
until the return of the general and the ten commissioners from
Macedon, who, after most carefully weighing the matter according
to the communications received in their letters and tablets,
were likely to give certain information relative to the
feelings which each state had borne towards Perseus or the
Romans. But when the pr&aelig;tor, nevertheless, persisted in his
determination, the matter came to this, that Antonius, the tribune
of the commons, after bringing the ambassadors before
the people, dragged down from the rostrum Thalna, who was
attempting to ascend it contrary to his wishes, and was beginning
to address the people, and gave the Rhodians an
opportunity of speaking before the general assembly. But
although the violent and, impetuous attempt of the pr&aelig;tor had
been defeated by corresponding firmness on the part of the
tribune, still anxiety did not as yet leave the minds of the
Rhodians; for the senators bore them a most unfriendly feeling;
so that the Rhodians were relieved from the impending
evil for the present, rather than completely rescued from it.
Therefore, when a meeting of the senate was granted to them,
after requesting it for a long time and frequently, on their
introduction by the consul they lay at first for a long time
with their persons prostrated on the ground; afterwards, when
the consul raised them up and ordered them to speak, Astymedes,
whose appearance was most calculated to excite pity,
spoke to the following effect: &#8220;Conscript fathers, this grief
and degradation of allies, who enjoyed your friendship a short

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2140" id="Page_2140">Pg 2140</a></span>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i22" name="i22"></a>22</span>
&#8220;Whether we Rhodians have transgressed, or not is
yet doubtful; meanwhile we suffer punishments and disgraces
of all sorts. In former times, when we visited Rome, after
the conquest of Carthage, after the defeat of Philip, and after
that of Antiochus, we <i>were escorted</i> from a mansion furnished
us by the public, into the senate-house, to present our congratulations
to you, conscript fathers, and, from the senate-house
to the Capitol, carrying offerings to your gods. But
now, from a vile and filthy inn, scarcely gaining a reception
for our money, treated as enemies, and forbid to lodge within
the city, we come in this squalid dress to the Roman senate-house:
we, Rhodians, on whom a short time ago you bestowed
the provinces of Lycia and Caria; on whom you conferred the
most ample rewards and honours. You order even the Macedonians
and Illyrians, as we hear, to be free; though they
were in servitude before they waged war with you: (nor do
we envy the good fortune of any; on the contrary, we acknowledge
therein the usual clemency of the Roman people.) But
will you convert, from allies into enemies, the Rhodians, who
were guilty of nothing more than remaining neutral during
the war? You are in truth the same Romans, who boast that
your wars are successful because they are just; who glory
not so much in the issue of them, in that you conquer, as
in the commencement of them, because you do not undertake
them without a just cause. The attack on Messana,
in Sicily, made the Carthaginians your enemies. The
siege of Athens, and attempt to reduce Greece to slavery,
together with the assistance of men and money given to
Hannibal, led to hostilities with Philip. Antiochus, on the
invitation of the &AElig;tolians, your enemies, came over in person
with a fleet from Asia to Greece; and by seizing Demetrias,
Chalcis, and the pass of Thermopylæ, endeavoured to
dispossess you of empire. The motives to your war with
Perseus were his attacks on your allies, and his putting
to death the princes and leading members of certain states.
But, if we are doomed to ruin, to what motive will our
misfortune be ascribed? I do not yet separate the cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2141" id="Page_2141">Pg 2141</a></span>
of the state from that of our countrymen, Polyaratus and
Dino, with others, whom we have brought hither in order to
deliver them into your hands. But supposing every one of
us were equally guilty, I ask what was our crime with
respect to the late war? We favoured the interest of Perseus;
and we have supported that prince against you in like
manner as, in the wars of Antiochus and Philip, we supported
you against those kings. Now, in what manner we are
accustomed to assist our allies, and with what vigour to conduct
wars, ask Caius Livius and Lucius &AElig;milius Regillus,
who commanded your fleets on the coasts of Asia. Your ships
never fought a battle without us. We, with our own fleet,
fought one engagement at Samos and a second on the coast of
Pamphylia, against that distinguished commander, Hannibal.
The victory, which we gained in the latter, was the more
glorious to us because, although we lost a great part of our
navy and the flower of our youth in the unsuccessful action
at Samos, we were not deterred from venturing again to give
battle to the king&#8217;s fleet on its return from Syria. These
matters I have mentioned not out of ostentation, (that would
ill become our present situation,) but to remind you in what
way the Rhodians assist their allies.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i23" name="i23"></a>23</span>
&#8220;When Philip and Antiochus were subdued, we
received from you very ample rewards. If the fortune of
Perseus were such as yours now is by the favour of the gods
and your own courage, and we were to go into Macedon, to
the victorious king, to demand rewards from him, what merit
should we have to plead? Is it that he was aided by us with
money or corn; with land or sea forces? Had we defended
his garrison? where had we, either under his generals or by
ourselves? If he should inquire where were our soldiers or
ships acting in concert with his; what answer could we give?
Perhaps we might be pleading our cause before him, if successful,
as we are now, before you. All that we have gained
by sending ambassadors to both, to mediate a peace, is, that
we received no thanks from either party, and incurred from
one of them accusations and danger. Perseus, indeed, might
justly object to us what you cannot, conscript fathers, that at
the commencement of the war we sent ambassadors to Rome,
promising supplies of all sorts requisite for the war, and engaging
to be ready, as in former wars, with our docks, our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2142" id="Page_2142">Pg 2142</a></span>
arms, and our men. It was your fault that we did not perform
this, since you, whatever was the reason, rejected our
assistance on that occasion. We have, therefore, neither
acted in any instance as enemies, nor been deficient in the
duty of well-affected allies; but we were prevented by you
from performing it. What then shall we say? Rhodians,
has there been nothing said or done in your country which
you disapprove of, and at which the Roman people would be
justly offended? Henceforth I do not mean to defend
what has been done, (I am not so weak,) but to distinguish
the cause of the public from the guilt of private men. For
there is no nation whatever that has not, generally, some ill-disposed
members, and always an ignorant populace. I have
heard, that even among the Romans there have been men
who worked themselves into power by courting the multitude;
that the plebeians sometimes seceded from you, and that the
government was not always in your hands. If it were possible
for this to happen in a state so well constituted, who can
wonder at there being some among us, who, out of a wish to
gain the king&#8217;s friendship, led our commons astray by bad
advice? Yet they effected nothing more than our remaining
inactive, without infringing on our duty. I shall not pass by
that, which has been made the heaviest charge against our
state during the war. We sent ambassadors at the same time
to you and Perseus, to mediate a peace; and that unfortunate
design was, by a furious orator, as we afterwards
heard, rendered foolish to the last degree; for it is ascertained
that he spoke in such a manner as Caius Popilius, the Roman
ambassador, should have spoken, when you sent him to the
two kings, Antiochus and Ptolemy, to induce them to cease
from hostilities. But still, whether this conduct is to be
called arrogance or folly, it was the same towards Perseus as
towards you. States, as well as individuals, have their
different characters; some are violent, others daring, others
timid; some addicted to wine, others more particularly to
women. Fame says that the Athenian nation was quick and
bold, beyond its strength, in beginning an enterprise; and
that the Laced&aelig;monian was dilatory and backward in entering
upon business, even when confident of success. I cannot
deny that Asia, throughout its whole extent, produces men
too much inclined to vanity, and that the speech of even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2143" id="Page_2143">Pg 2143</a></span>
Rhodians is too much tinctured with vain-glory, because we
seem to have the pre-eminence above the neighbouring states;
and that, too, owing not so much to our strength as to the
marks of honour and esteem conferred on us by you. That
embassy received on the spot sufficient reproof for its immediate
misconduct, when it was dismissed with so severe an
answer. But, if the disgrace which we then suffered was
too trifling, surely the present mournful and suppliant embassy
would be a sufficient expiation for an embassy even
more insolent than that was. Irritable men hate arrogance;
men of sense despise it, particularly if shown in words; more
especially, if it be shown by an inferior towards a superior;
but no one has ever yet thought it deserving of capital punishment.
There was, in truth, danger lest the Rhodians
should contemn the Romans! Some men have spoken, even
of the gods, in terms too presumptuous; yet we have never
heard of any one being struck with thunder on that account.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i24" name="i24"></a>24</span>
&#8220;What charge then remains, of which we are to acquit
ourselves, since there has been no hostile act on our part, and
the insolent language of an ambassador, though grating to the
ear, has not deserved the ruin of a state. Conscript fathers,
I hear that the estimate of the penalty for our secret wishes
has become the subject of your conversation. Some assert
that we favoured the king, and therefore that we should be
punished with war; others, that we did indeed wish him
success, but ought not, on that account, to suffer the penalty
of war, since it has not been so instituted either by the practice
or laws of any state, that if any one should wish an
enemy to perish, he should be condemned, provided that he
did nothing towards effecting his wishes. We feel, indeed,
grateful to those who absolve us from the punishment, though
not from the crime; but we lay down this law for ourselves:
if we all entertained the wishes of which we are accused, we
will then make no distinction between the will and the deed:
let us all be punished. If some of our people in power favoured
you, and others the king, I do not demand, that for the sake
of us who were on your side, the favourers of the king may
be saved; but I deprecate our perishing through them. You
are not more inveterate against them than is our state itself;
and most of them, when they ascertained this, fled, or put
themselves to death, the others have been condemned by us, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2144" id="Page_2144">Pg 2144</a></span>
they will soon be in your power, conscript fathers. The rest
of us Rhodians, as we have merited no thanks during the war,
so neither have we deserved punishment. Let the accumulation
of our former services atone for our present dereliction
of duty. You have recently waged war with three kings: let
not the circumstance of our having been inactive in one of
these wars, be more injurious to us than our having fought
on your side in the other two has served us. Consider
Philip, Antiochus, and Perseus, as you would three votes;
two of them acquit us; one, although it would be unfavourable,
is nevertheless doubtful. If they were to sit in judgment
over us, we would be condemned. Conscript fathers,
you are to decide, whether Rhodes is to continue on the earth
or to be utterly destroyed. You are not deliberating concerning
war, conscript fathers, for though it is in your power
to declare war, it is not in your power to wage it, as not a
single Rhodian will take up arms against you. If you persist
in your anger, we will beg time from you, until we carry
home an account of this unhappy embassy. We will then,
every free person of all the Rhodians, both men and women,
with all our wealth, embark in ships, and leaving the seats of
our tutelar deities, both public and private, repair to Rome,
where, heaping together in the Comitium, at the door of your
senate-house, all our gold and silver, all the public and private
property that we possess, we will submit our persons, and
those of our wives and children, to your disposal; that, whatever
we are to suffer, we may suffer here. Let our city be
sacked and burned far away from our view. The Romans
may pass a judgment, that the Rhodians are enemies; but we
have also a right, in some degree, to judge ourselves; and we
never will judge ourselves your enemies, nor do one hostile
act, should we even suffer extreme calamities.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i25" name="i25"></a>25</span>
After so mournful a speech, they all prostrated themselves
again, and as supplicants, held out olive branches; but
at length they were raised, and withdrew from the senate-house.
They then began to ask the opinions of the senators.
The most inveterate against the Rhodians were those, who as
consuls, pr&aelig;tors, or lieutenant-generals, had been engaged in
the war with Macedon. Marcus Porcius Cato was the principal
supporter of their cause, who, though naturally austere,
acted his part as a senator, on this occasion, with much mildness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2145" id="Page_2145">Pg 2145</a></span>
and lenity. I will not introduce here a specimen of his
copious eloquence, by relating what he said: his speech is
extant, and is comprised in the fifth book of his Antiquities.
The answer given to the Rhodians was, that &#8220;they should
neither be declared enemies, nor any longer remain in
alliance with Rome.&#8221; At the head of this embassy were
Philocrates and Astymedes. They determined that half their
number, with Philocrates, should carry home to Rhodes an account
of their proceedings; and that the other half, with Astymedes,
should remain at Rome, that they might be acquainted
with what passed, and inform their countrymen. For the
present, they were commanded to remove their governors out
of Lycia and Caria, before a certain day. This intelligence
was announced at Rhodes; and although it was galling in
itself, yet as the Rhodians were relieved from the dread of a
greater evil, for they had feared a war, the announcement
created joy. They therefore immediately voted a present,
amounting in value to twenty thousand pieces of gold, and
deputed The&aelig;tetus, the commander of their fleet, on that
embassy. They wished to procure an alliance with the
Romans; but, in such a manner, as that no order of the
people should pass concerning it, nor any thing be committed
to writing; for in either of these cases, if they failed in succeeding,
there would be greater disgrace in the refusal. The
admiral of the fleet was empowered, singly, to negotiate that
business, if he could effect it without any law being brought
forward at Rome on the subject; for, during a considerable
length of time, they had maintained a friendship with the
Romans, in such a manner as not to bind themselves by a
treaty of alliance, for no other reason than that they might
neither preclude the kings from all hope of their assistance,
if any of them should need it, nor themselves from a participation
of the advantages which might accrue from the good
fortune and liberality of the said kings. At this time, however,
an alliance seemed particularly desirable, not to render
them more secure from others, (for excepting the Romans,
they feared none,) but to make them less suspected by the
Romans themselves. About this time, the Caunians revolted
from them, and the Mylasensians seized on the towns of the
Euromensians. The spirit of their community was not so
totally broken as to hinder their perceiving, that, if Lycia and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2146" id="Page_2146">Pg 2146</a></span>
Caria were taken from them by the Romans, their other provinces
would either assert their own freedom by a revolt, or be
seized on by their neighbours; and that they themselves would
then be shut up in a small island; within the shores of a
barren country, which could by no means maintain the
numerous people in so large a city. They therefore sent out
with all speed, a body of troops, and reduced the Caunians to
obedience, though they had received succours from Cybara:
and afterwards defeated in a battle at Orthosia the Mylassians
and Alabandians, who, having seized the province of Euroma,
had marched against them with their allied forces.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i26" name="i26"></a>26</span>
Whilst these events are occurring in Rhodes, different
matters are going on in Macedon and Rome; in the mean time,
in Illyria, Lucius Anicius, having reduced king Gentius under
his power, as before mentioned, placed Gabinius over a garrison
that he posted in Scodra, which had been the capital of
the kingdom; and appointed Caius Licinius commander in
Rhizon and Olcinium, which were towns very conveniently
situated. Leaving these two in charge of Illyria, he marched
with the rest of his forces into Epirus. Here, Phanota was the
first place which submitted to him; the whole multitude, with
fillets on their heads, coming out to meet him. Placing a
garrison there, he went over into Molossis, all the towns of
which province, except Passora, Tecmo, Phylace, and Horreum,
having surrendered, he marched first against Passora.
The two men of the greatest authority in that city, were
Antinous and Theodotus, who were remarkable for their warm
attachment to Perseus, and hatred to the Romans; the same
individuals had instigated the whole nation to revolt from
the Romans. These men, since they had no hope of pardon,
owing to their consciousness of guilt, shut the gates, that they
might be buried under the general ruin of their country, and
exhorted the multitude to prefer death to slavery. No man
dared to open his lips against men of such transcendent power.
At last one Theodotus, a young man of distinction, (when
his greater dread of the Romans had overpowered the lesser
fear of his own leaders,) exclaimed, &#8220;What madness has
seized you, to make the public accessory to the crimes of two
individuals? I have often heard mention made of men who
offered themselves to death for the sake of their country; but
those are the first that were ever found, who required that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2147" id="Page_2147">Pg 2147</a></span>
their country should perish for them. Why not open our
gates, and submit to that power to which the whole world has
submitted?&#8221; As he spoke thus, the multitude followed him;
on which Antinous and Theodotus rushed out on the advanced
guards of the enemy, and freely exposing themselves to their
weapons, were slain, and the city was surrendered to the
Romans. Through a similar obstinacy in Cephalus, a man in
power, the gates of Tecmo were shut: when he was put to
death, Anicius received the surrender of the town. Neither
Phylace nor Horreum stood a siege. Having thus reduced
Epirus, Anicius distributed his troops in winter quarters,
through the most convenient towns; and returning into
Illyria, held a general convention at Scodra, where the five
commissioners had arrived from Rome, and to which place he
had summoned the principal men from all parts of the province.
There, with advice of the council, he proclaimed from
his tribunal, that &#8220;the senate and people of Rome granted freedom
to the Illyrians; and that he would withdraw his garrisons
from all their towns, citadels, and castles. That the
Issensians and Taulantians, with the Pirustans, that were
included among the Dassaretians, the Rhizonites, and the
Olcinians, should not only enjoy liberty, but likewise an immunity
from taxes; because when Gentius was in his full
strength, they had revolted to the Romans. That the same
exemption was granted to the Daorseans; because they forsook
Caravantius, and came over with their arms to the
Romans; and that the Scodrans, Dassaretians, Selepitans,
and the rest of the Illyrians, should pay half the taxes which
they had formerly paid to their king.&#8221; He then divided
Illyria into three districts; he made the first division out of
the people above mentioned, the second comprehended all the
Labeatians, and the third the Agranonites, Rhizonites, and
Olcinians, with the contiguous states. Having established
this constitution in Illyria, he returned into Epirus, to his
winter quarters at Passaro.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i27" name="i27"></a>27</span>
While these matters are passing in Illyria, Paullus,
before the arrival of the ten commissioners, sent his son
Quintus Maximus, who was by this time returned from Rome,
to sack Agass&aelig; and &AElig;ginium: Agass&aelig;, because the inhabitants,
after surrendering their city to the consul, and voluntarily
soliciting an alliance with Rome, had revolted again to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2148" id="Page_2148">Pg 2148</a></span>
Perseus: the crime of the people of &AElig;ginium was of a late
date; not giving credit to the report of the Romans being
victorious, they had treated with hostile cruelty some soldiers
who came into the city. He also detached Lucius Postumius
to pillage the city of &AElig;nia; because the inhabitants had continued
in arms with more obstinacy than the neighbouring
states. Autumn now drew nigh; at the commencement of this
season, when he resolved to make a tour through Greece, in
order to take a view of those curiosities, which, being celebrated
by fame, are represented as greater than they really are when
examined by the eye, he gave the command of his quarters to
Caius Sulpicius Gallus, and, with a moderate retinue, began
his journey, accompanied by his son Scipio, and Athen&aelig;us,
king Eumenes&#8217; brother, and directed his route through Thessaly
to the famous oracle at Delphi; where he offered sacrifices
to Apollo, and, in honour of his victory, destined for his
own statues some unfinished columns in the vestibule, on which
they had intended to place statues of king Perseus. He also
visited the temple of Jupiter Trophonius at Lebadia; where,
after viewing the mouth of the cave, through which people
applying to the oracle descend, in order to obtain information
from the gods, he sacrificed to Jupiter and Hercyna, who
have a temple there; and then went down to Chalcis, to see
the curiosities of the Euripus, and of the island of Eub&#339;a,
which is there united to the continent by a bridge. From
Chalcis he passed by sea to Aulis, a port three miles distant,
famous for having been formerly the station of Agamemnon&#8217;s
fleet of one thousand ships, and distinguished also for the
temple of Diana, in which that king of kings sought a
passage for his fleet to Troy, by offering his daughter Iphigenia
as a victim at the altar. Thence he came to Oropus, in
Attica; where an ancient prophet is worshipped as a god, and
has an old temple, rendered delightful by the surrounding
springs and streams. He then went to Athens, which, though
filled with only the decayed relics of ancient grandeur, still
contained many things worthy of observation; the citadel, the
port, the walls connecting Pir&aelig;eus with the city; the dockyards,
the monuments of illustrious generals, the statues of
gods and men, alike remarkable for the variety of the materials
and the ingenuity of the artists.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i28" name="i28"></a>28</span>
After sacrificing to Minerva, the guardian of the citadel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2149" id="Page_2149">Pg 2149</a></span>
he continued his journey, and on the second day arrived at
Corinth. The city was then flourishing, as this visit was prior
to its fall; the citadel too, and the isthmus, afforded admirable
views; the former, within the walls, and towering up to
an immense height, yet abounding with springs; and the
latter, separating by a narrow neck two seas, which wash it
on the east and west. He next visited the celebrated cities of
Sicyon and Argos; then Epidaurus, which, though unequal
to them in opulence, was yet remarkable for a famous temple
of Esculapius, which, standing at five miles&#8217; distance from the
city, was at that time rich in offerings, which the sick had
dedicated to that deity, as an acknowledgment for the remedies
which restored them to health; but now, full of the traces of
them only, whence they have been torn away. Thence he
proceeded to Laced&aelig;mon, renowned, not for magnificent
works of art, but for its laws and discipline; and then, passing
through Magalopolis, he went up to Olympia. Here, having
taken a view of all things worthy of notice, and beholding
Jupiter in a manner present before him, he was struck with
the deepest reverence; therefore he ordered preparations to
be made for a sacrifice, with more than usual magnificence,
and as if he were going to make offerings in the Capitol;
having made his circuit through Greece in such a manner as
not to inquire into the sentiments which any one, either in
his public or private capacity, entertained in the war against
Perseus, lest he might disturb the minds of the allies with any
kind of apprehensions. On his way back to Demetrias, a crowd
of &AElig;tolians, in mourning apparel, met him: on his expressing
surprise, and asking the reason of this proceeding, he was told
that five hundred and fifty of the chief of their countrymen
had been put to death by Lyciscus and Tisippus, who surrounded
their senate with Roman soldiers, sent by their commander
B&aelig;bius; that others had been driven into exile; and
that the accusers were in possession of the goods of the killed
and exiled. They were ordered to wait on him at Amphipolis;
and then, having met Cneius Octavius at Demetrias, who informed
him that the ten commissioners were landed, he laid
aside all other business, and went to Apollonia to meet them.
And when Perseus, owing to the negligence of his guard, had
come hither to meet him from Amphipolis, (the distance is a
day&#8217;s journey,) &AElig;milius spoke to him with great courtesy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2150" id="Page_2150">Pg 2150</a></span>
but is said to have severely reprimanded Caius Sulpicius,
when he reached the camp at Amphipolis; first, for allowing
Perseus thus to ramble through the province, and next, for
indulging the soldiers so far as to suffer them to strip the
buildings on the city walls of the tiles, in order to cover their
own winter huts. These tiles he ordered to be carried back
the buildings to be repaired, and put in their former condition.
He gave in charge to Aulus Postumius, Perseus, with his
elder son Philip, and sent them into a place of confinement;
his daughter and younger son he ordered to be brought from
Samothrace to Amphipolis, and treated them with all possible
kindness.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i29" name="i29"></a>29</span>
When the day arrived, on which he had ordered ten
chiefs from each of the states to attend at Amphipolis, and all
the writings wherever deposited, and the money belonging to
the king, to be brought thither, he seated himself, with the
ten commissioners, on his tribunal, while the whole multitude
of the Macedonians surrounded him. Though they were
inured to the government of a king, yet the strange tribunal
presented a terrible appearance; the path that was cleared
towards the pr&aelig;tor by the removal of the people, the herald,
the sergeant, were all objects strange to their eyes and ears,
and capable of inspiring awe in allies, much more in conquered
enemies. Silence being proclaimed by the herald, Paullus
declared in the Latin language the regulations adopted by the
senate, and by himself with the advice of the council; and
the pr&aelig;tor, Cneius Octavius, (for he too was present,) translated
them into the Greek language, and read them aloud.
First of all he ordered, that &#8220;the Macedonians should live free;
possessing the same cities and lands as before; governed by
their own laws, and creating annual magistrates; and that they
should pay to the Roman people one-half of the taxes which
they had paid to their kings. Next, that Macedon should
be divided into four districts. That the division which should
be deemed the first, should comprehend the lands between the
rivers Strymon and Nessus: to this territory should be added
the territory beyond the Nessus, towards the east, wherein
Perseus had possessed villages, castles, or towns, excepting
&AElig;nus, Maronea, and Abdera; and the country beyond the
Strymon, verging towards the west, including all Bisaltica,
with Heraclea, which they call Sintice. That the second district
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2151" id="Page_2151">Pg 2151</a></span>
should be the country enclosed by the river Strymon, on
the east, where were excepted Sintice-Heraclea and Bisaltica,
and by the river Axius on the west; to which should be
added the P&#339;nians, who dwelt near the river Axius, and on
its right bank. The third district comprised the territory
bounded by the river Axius on the east, the Peneus on the
west, and Mount Bora on the north. That to this division
should be joined that tract of P&aelig;onia, which stretches along
the western side of the Axius; Edessa also, and Ber&#339;a, should
be united to it. The fourth district was to consist of the
country on the north of Mount Bora, touching Illyria on one
side, and Epirus on the other. He then appointed the capitals
of the districts in which the councils should be held: of the
first district, Amphipolis; of the second, Thessalonica; of the
third, Pella; and of the fourth, Pelagonia. In these he ordered
that the councils of the several districts should be assembled,
the public money deposited, and the magistrates elected.&#8221;
He then gave notice, &#8220;that it was determined, that there should
not be intermarriage, nor liberty to purchase lands or houses,
out of the limits of their respective districts, that the mines
of gold and silver must not be worked; but those of iron and
copper might.&#8221; The tax imposed upon such persons as worked
them, was one half of that which they had paid to the
king. He likewise forbade the use of imported salt. To the
Dardanians, who laid claim to P&aelig;onia, because it had formerly
been theirs, and was contiguous to their territory, he declared
that, &#8220;he gave liberty to all who had been under subjection
to Perseus.&#8221; After the refusal of P&aelig;onia, he granted them
liberty to purchase salt, and ordered that the third district
should bring it down to Stobi, in P&aelig;onia; and he fixed the
price to be paid for it. He prohibited them from cutting ship
timber themselves, or suffering others to cut it. To those
districts which bordered on the barbarians, (and excepting the
third, this was the case with them all,) he gave permission to
keep armed forces on their frontiers.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i30" name="i30"></a>30</span>
These terms, announced on the first day of the convention,
affected the minds of those who were present with very
different emotions. Liberty being granted them beyond their
expectation, and the annual tribute being lightened, gave them
high satisfaction; but then, by the prohibition of a commercial
intercourse between the districts, Macedon appeared dismembered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2152" id="Page_2152">Pg 2152</a></span>
like an animal torn asunder into separate limbs, which
stood in need of mutual aid from each other; so little did the
Macedonians themselves know how great was the extent of
their country, how aptly it was formed for a division and
how content each part could be with its own resources. The
first division contains the Bisaltians, men of the greatest
courage (residing beyond the river Nessus, and on both sides
of the Strymon); it has many peculiar productions of the
vegetable kingdom, and mines also, and the advantages derived
from the city of Amphipolis, which, standing just in the way,
shuts up every passage into Macedonia from the east. The
second division has two very remarkable cities, Thessalonica
and Cassandria, and the country of Pallene, producing grain
and fruits in abundance; its harbours at Torone and Mount
Athos, (they call the latter the port of &AElig;nea,) besides others,
some of which are conveniently situated opposite Eub&#339;a, and
some upon the Hellespont, give it opportunities for maritime
business. The third district has the celebrated cities of Edessa,
Ber&#339;a, and Pella; and is partly inhabited by the Vettians, a
warlike people; also by great numbers of Gauls and Illyrians,
who are industrious husbandmen. The fourth district is
occupied by the Eord&aelig;ans, Lyncestans, and Pelagonians, to
whom are joined Atintania, Stymphalis, and Elemiotis. All
this tract is cold and rough, and unfavourable to tillage; it
has men whose dispositions are like the land that they till.
Their vicinity to the barbarians renders them more ferocious;
for they at one time inure them to arms, and at another are
in peace, and introduce their customs among them. Having
separated the interests of the several districts of Macedon
by this division, he declared that he would give them a constitution
which should bind the Macedonians in general, when
he was prepared to give them a body of laws also.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i31" name="i31"></a>31</span>
The &AElig;tolians were then summoned to appear; in which
trial the inquiry was directed to discover, rather, which party
had favoured the Romans, and which the king, than which
had done, and which suffered injury; for the murderers were
absolved from guilt, and likewise the banishment of the exiles
confirmed, and the death of the citizens overlooked. Aulus
B&aelig;bius alone was condemned for having lent Roman soldiers
as agents in the butchery. This result in the case of the
&AElig;tolians puffed up the party which favoured the Romans to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2153" id="Page_2153">Pg 2153</a></span>
an intolerable degree of arrogance, throughout all the states
and nations of Greece; and subjected all those, on whom the
slightest suspicion of being in the king&#8217;s interest fell, to be
trodden under their feet. Of the leading men in the states,
there were three parties; two of which paying servile court
either to the Romans, or the kings, sought to aggrandize
themselves by enslaving their countries; while one, adopting
a middle course, and struggling against both, stood up in
support of their laws and liberty. Although the last had the
greatest share of the affection of their countrymen, still they
had the least interest among foreigners. The partisans of the
Romans being elated by the success of their party, alone held
the offices of magistracy, and alone were employed on embassies.
Great numbers of these, coming from the diets of Peloponnesus,
B&#339;otia, and other parts of Greece, filled the ears of the
ten commissioners with insinuations, that &#8220;those who, through
folly, had openly boasted of being friends and intimates of
Perseus, were not the only persons who had favoured his
cause; much greater numbers had done so in secret. That
there was another party, who under pretence of supporting
liberty, had, in the diets, advanced every measure contrary
to the Romans; and that these nations would not continue
faithful, unless the spirit of these parties was broken, and
the influence of those, who had no other object than the
advancement of the Roman power, was augmented and
strengthened.&#8221; These persons, whose names were given in
by this clique, were summoned by the general&#8217;s letter out of
&AElig;tolia, Acarnania, Epirus, and B&#339;otia, to follow him to Rome,
and plead their cause. Two of the ten commissioners, Caius
Claudius and Cneius Domitius, went to Achaia, that they
might, on the spot, summon by proclamation the persons implicated.
This was done for two reasons; one was because
they believed that the Ach&aelig;ans would have greater spirit and
confidence than the rest, and might disobey, and perhaps even
endanger Callicrates, and other authors of the charges, and
informers. The other reason for summoning them on the
spot, was, that the commissioners had in their possession
letters from the chief men of the other nations, which had
been found among the king&#8217;s papers; but with regard to the
Ach&aelig;ans the charges were not clear, because no letters of
theirs had been discovered. When the &AElig;tolians were dismissed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2154" id="Page_2154">Pg 2154</a></span>
the Acarnanian nation was called in. No alteration was
made in their situation, only Leucas was disunited from their
council. Then making more extensive inquiries respecting
those who had, publicly or privately, favoured the king, they
extended their jurisdiction even into Asia, and sent Labeo to
demolish Antissa, in the island of Lesbos, and to remove the
inhabitants to Methymna; because they had received within
their port, and supplied with provisions, Antenor, the commander
of the king&#8217;s fleet, while cruising with his squadron
on the coast of Lesbos. Two distinguished men were beheaded,
Andronicus, son of Andronicus, an &AElig;tolian, because,
imitating his father, he had borne arms against the Roman
people; and Neo, a Theban, by whose advice his countrymen
had formed an alliance with Perseus.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i32" name="i32"></a>32</span>
This examination into foreign matters having intervened,
the general assembly of the Macedonians was again
summoned, and information was given them that &#8220;with regard
to the government of Macedon, they must elect senators called
by themselves Synedroi, by whose advice the republic should be
directed.&#8221; Then was read a list of Macedonians of distinction,
who, with their children above fifteen years of age, were
ordered to go before him into Italy. This injunction, at first
view cruel, appeared afterwards to the Macedonian populace
to have been intended in favour of their freedom. For the
persons named were Perseus&#8217;s friends and courtiers, the
generals of his armies, and the commanders of his ships or
garrisons; men accustomed to pay servile obedience to the
king, and to domineer haughtily over others; some immoderately
rich, others vying in expense with those to whom they were
unequal in fortune, all living in regal pomp and luxury; in a
word, none possessed of a disposition suited to a member of a
commonwealth, and all incapable of paying due obedience to
the laws, and of enjoying an equal participation of liberty.
All, therefore, who had held any employment under the king,
even those who had been upon the most trivial embassies,
were ordered to leave Macedon and go into Italy; and the
penalty of death was denounced against any who disobeyed
the mandate. He framed laws for Macedon with such care,
that he seemed to be giving them not to vanquished foes, but
to allies who had merited well; laws so wise, that even experience
(which is the only corrector of laws) could not find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2155" id="Page_2155">Pg 2155</a></span>
any fault in them after a long trial. Turning from serious
business, he celebrated with great pomp at Amphipolis games,
for which he had been making preparations for a long time,
having sent people to the states and kings in Asia to give notice
of the intended diversions, and in his late tour through Greece
he had himself mentioned his design to the principal people.
There came thither from every region in the world, multitudes
of artists of every sort, skilled in such exhibitions, and vast
numbers of wrestlers and noble horses; deputations also came
with victims and every other mark of respect usually shown
out of regard to gods or men, in great games of Greece.
Hence it came to pass, that the people admired not only the
magnificence, but likewise the skill displayed in the entertainments;
in which kind of business the Romans were, at that
time, quite inexperienced. Feasts were also provided for the
ambassadors with the same degree of care and opulence. They
made frequent mention of an expression of his, that to furnish
out a feast, and to conduct games, seldom fell to the lot of him
who knew how to conquer.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i33" name="i33"></a>33</span>
When the games of every kind were finished, he put
the brazen shields on board the ships; the rest of the arms,
being all collected together in a huge pile, the general himself,
after praying to Mars, Minerva, mother Lua, and the other
deities, to whom it is right and proper to dedicate the spoils
of enemies, set fire to them with a torch, and then the military
tribunes who stood round all threw fire on the same. It was
remarkable, that, at such a general congress of Europe and
Asia, where such multitudes were assembled, some to congratulate
the victors, some to see the shows; and where such
numerous bodies of land and naval forces were quartered, so
great was the plenty of every thing, and so moderate the
price of provisions, that presents of divers articles were made
by the general to private persons, and states, and nations;
not only for their present use, but even to carry home with
them. The stage entertainments, the gymnastics, and the
horse races, did not afford a more pleasing spectacle to the
crowd which had assembled, than the Macedonian booty,
which was all exposed to view, consisting of the ornaments
of the palace at Pella, namely, statues, pictures, tapestry, and
vases, formed of gold, silver, brass, and ivory, in so elaborate
a manner, that they seemed intended not merely for present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2156" id="Page_2156">Pg 2156</a></span>
show, like the furniture of the palace of Alexandria but
even for continual use. These were embarked in the fleet and
given in charge to Cneius Octavius, to be carried to Rome.
Paullus, after dismissing the ambassadors with great courtesy,
crossed the Strymon, and encamped at the distance of a mile
from Amphipolis; then resuming his march, he arrived on
the fifth day at Pella. Having passed by that city, he halted
for two days at a place called Spel&aelig;um, and detached his son
Quintus Maximus and Publius Nasica, with half of the troops,
to lay waste the country of the Illyrians, who had assisted
Perseus in the war, ordering them to meet him at Oricum;
then, taking the road to Epirus, on his fifteenth encampment,
he reached the city of Passaro.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i34" name="i34"></a>34</span>
Not far from this was the camp of Anicius, to whom
he sent a letter, desiring him not to be alarmed at any thing
that should happen, for &#8220;the senate had granted to his soldiers
the plunder of those cities in Epirus which had revolted to
Perseus.&#8221; Having despatched centurions, who were to give
out that they came to bring away the garrisons, in order that
the Epirotes might be free, as well as the Macedonians; he
summoned before him ten of the principal men of each city,
and after giving them strict injunctions that all their gold and
silver should be brought into the public street, he then sent
cohorts to the several states. Those that were destined for
the more remote states set out earlier than those who were
sent to the nearer, that they might all arrive on the same day.
The tribunes and centurions were instructed how to act. Early
in the morning all the treasure was collected; at the fourth
hour the signal was given to the soldiers to plunder, and so
ample was the booty acquired, that the shares distributed were
four hundred denariuses<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> to a horseman, and two hundred to
a footman. One hundred and fifty thousand persons were led
away captive. Then the walls of the plundered cities, they
were about seventy in number, were razed; the effects sold,
and the soldiers&#8217; shares paid out of the price. Paullus then
marched down to the sea to Oricum, having by no means
satisfied the wishes of his men as he had imagined, for they
were enraged at being excluded from sharing in the spoil of
the king, as if they had not waged any war in Macedon.
When he found, at Oricum, the troops sent with his son Maximus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2157" id="Page_2157">Pg 2157</a></span>
and Scipio Nasica, he embarked the army, and sailed over
to Italy. Anicius, a few days after, having held a convention
of the rest of the Epirotes and Acarnanians, and having ordered
those of their chiefs, whose cases he had reserved for consideration,
to follow him into Italy, waited only for the return of
the ships that the Macedonian army had used, and then passed
over to Italy. At the time that these events took place in
Macedon and Epirus, the ambassadors that had been sent with
Attalus, to put a stop to hostilities between the Gauls and king
Eumenes, arrived in Asia. Having agreed to a suspension of
arms for the winter, the Gauls were gone home, and the king
had retired to Pergamus into winter quarters, where he fell sick
of a grievous disease. The first appearance of spring drew
out both parties from their respective homes; the Gauls had
advanced as far as Synnada, while Eumenes had collected
from every quarter his forces, at Sardis. Then the Romans
held a conference with Solovettius, general of the Gauls, at
Synnada, and Attalus accompanied them; but it was not
thought proper that he should enter the camp of the Gauls,
lest the passions of either party might be heated by debate.
Publius Licinius held a conference with the Gallic chieftain,
and brought back word that he was rendered more haughty
by the attempt to persuade him; so that it might, therefore,
seem matter of wonder that the mediation of Roman ambassadors
should have had so great influence on Antiochus and
Ptolemy, two powerful kings, as to make them instantly conclude
a peace; and yet, that it had no influence with the
Gauls.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i35" name="i35"></a>35</span>
The captive kings, Perseus and Gentius, with their
children, were the first brought to Rome, and put in custody,
and next the other prisoners; then such of the Macedonians
and principal men of Greece as had been ordered to come to
Rome; for of these, not only such as were at home were summoned
by letter, but even those who were said to be at the
courts of the kings. In a few days after, Paullus was carried
up the Tiber to the city, in a royal galley of vast size, which
was moved by sixteen tiers of oars, and decorated with Macedonian
spoils, consisting not only of beautiful armour, but
of tapestry, which had been the property of the king; while
the banks of the river were covered with the multitudes that
poured out to do him honour. After a few days, arrived Anicius,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2158" id="Page_2158">Pg 2158</a></span>
and Cneius Octavius with his fleet. A triumph was
voted by the senate to all three: and instructions were given
to Quintus Cassius, the pr&aelig;tor, to apply to the plebeian tribunes,
who, by the authority of the senate, should propose to the
commons the passing of an order to invest them with military
command during the day on which they should ride through
the city in triumph. Those in the middle rank are never
assailed by popular displeasure, which usually aims at the
highest. With regard to the triumphs of Anicius and Octavius,
no hesitation was made; yet they detracted from the
merits of Paullus, with whom these men could not, without
blushing, set themselves in comparison. He had kept his
soldiers under the ancient rules of discipline, and had made
smaller donations out of the spoil, than they hoped to receive,
since the treasures of the king were so large; for
if he had indulged their avarice, there would have left nothing
to be carried to the treasury. The whole Macedonian army
was disposed to attend negligently in support of their commander,
at the assembly held for the passing of the order.
But Servius Sulpicius Galba, (who had been military tribune
of the second legion in Macedon, and who was a personal
enemy of the general,) by his own importunities, and by soliciting
them through the soldiers of his own legion, had
instigated them to attend in full numbers, to give their votes,
and to &#8220;take revenge on a haughty and morose commander,
by rejecting the order proposed for his triumph. The commons
of the city would follow the judgment of the soldiery. Was
it probable that he could not give the money? The soldiers
could confer honours! Let him not hope to reap the fruits
of gratitude among those from whom he had not merited
them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i36" name="i36"></a>36</span>
The soldiers were urged on by these expressions, and
when, in the Capitol, Tiberius Sempronius, tribune of the
commons, proposed the order, and private citizens had an opportunity
of speaking on the law, no one came forward to
speak in favour of it, as there was not a doubt entertained of
its passing. Whereupon Servius Galba suddenly came forward
and demanded of the tribune, that, &#8220;as it was then the eighth
hour, and as there would not be time enough to produce all
the reasons for not ordering a triumph to Lucius &AElig;milius, they
should adjourn to the next day, and proceed with the business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2159" id="Page_2159">Pg 2159</a></span>
early in the morning: for he would require an entire day to
plead that cause.&#8221; When the tribune desired, that he would
say then whatever he chose to object; by his speech he
protracted the affair until night, representing to the people
and reminding the soldiers, that &#8220;the duties of the service had
been enforced with unusual severity; that greater toil and
greater danger had been imposed on them than the occasion
required; while, on the other hand, in respect of rewards and
honours, every thing was conducted on the narrowest scale;
and if such commanders succeeded, military employment would
become more irksome and more laborious to the soldiers, while
it would produce to the conquerors neither riches nor honours.
That the Macedonians were in a better condition than the
Roman soldiers. If they would attend next day, in full numbers,
to reject the order, men in power would learn, that every
thing was not in the disposal of the commander, but that there
was something in that of the soldiery.&#8221; The soldiers, instigated
by such arguments, filled the Capitol next day with such
a crowd, that no one else could find room to vote. When the
tribes which were first called in gave a negative to the question,
the principal men in the state ran together to the Capitol, crying
out, that &#8220;it was a shameful thing that Lucius Paullus, after
his success in such an important war, should be robbed of a
triumph; that commanders should be given up, in a state of
subjection, to the licentiousness and avarice of their men.
As it was, too many errors were made through a desire to
gain popularity; but what must be the consequence if the
soldiers were raised into the place of masters over their
generals?&#8221; All heaped violent reproaches on Galba. At last,
when the uproar was calmed, Marcus Servilius, who had been
consul and master of the horse, requested from the tribunes
that they would begin the proceedings anew, and give him an
opportunity of speaking to the people. These, after withdrawing
to deliberate, being overcome by the influence of the leading
men of the state, began the proceedings over again, and
declared that they would call back the tribes as soon as Servilius
and other private persons should have delivered their
sentiments.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i37" name="i37"></a>37</span>
Servilius then said: &#8220;Romans, if we had no other
means of judging what a consummate commander Lucius &AElig;milius
was, this one would be sufficient: that, notwithstanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2160" id="Page_2160">Pg 2160</a></span>
he had in his camp soldiers so fickle and mutinously inclined,
with an enemy so noble, so zealous, and so eloquent, to
stir up the passions of the multitude, yet he never had any
sedition in his army. That strictness of discipline, which
they now hate, kept them then in order. Subjected to the
ancient rules, they did not mutiny. If truly, Servius Galba
wished to make his debut as an orator in the case of Lucius
Paullus, and to give a specimen of his eloquence, still he
ought not to obstruct his triumph, since, if there was no
other reason in its favour, the senate had judged it to be well
merited. But on the day after the triumph, when he should
see &AElig;milius in a private station, he should prefer a charge,
and prosecute him according to the laws; or else, at a later
period, when he himself should be invested with magistracy,
let him cite Paullus to a trial, and accuse his enemy before
the people. By such conduct Lucius Paullus would both receive
the reward of his proper conduct, a triumph for extraordinary
success in war, and also meet punishment, if he had
committed any thing unworthy of his former or present reputation.
Instead of which, he has undertaken to detract from
the merits of a man to whom he cannot impute either crime
or dishonour. Yesterday he demanded a whole day, for
making his charges against Lucius Paullus, and he spent four
hours, which remained of that day, in delivering a speech to that
purpose. What accused man was ever so transcendently
wicked, that the offence of his life could not be set forth in
that number of hours? And yet, in all that time, what did
he object to him, that Lucius Paullus, if actually on his trial,
would have wished to be denied? Let any one with me fancy
for a moment, two assemblies: one composed of the soldiers
who served in Macedon; the other, of sounder judgment, unbiassed
either by favour or dislike; where the whole body of
the Roman people is the judge. Let the cause of the accused
be pleaded, first, before the citizens, peaceably assembled in
their gowns. Servius Galba, what have you to say before the
Roman citizens? for such a discourse, as you made before, is
totally precluded. You were obliged to stand at your posts
with too much strictness and attention; the watches were
visited with too much exactness and severity; you had more
fatigue than formerly, because the general himself went the
rounds, and enforced the duties. On the same day you performed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2161" id="Page_2161">Pg 2161</a></span>
a march, and, without repose, were led forth to battle.
Even when you had gained a victory, he did not allow you
rest: he led you immediately in pursuit of the enemy. When
he has it in his power to make you rich, by dividing the spoil,
he intends to carry the king&#8217;s treasure in his triumph, and
deposit it in the treasury. Though these arguments may
have some incentive to stimulate the passions of soldiers, who
imagine that too little deference has been shown to their
licentious temper, and too little indulgence to their avarice;
yet they would have no kind of influence on the judgment of
the Roman people; who, though they should not recollect old
accounts, and what they heard from their parents, of the
numerous defeats suffered in consequence of the desire of
commanders to gain popularity, or of victories gained in consequence
of strict enforcement of discipline; yet must they
surely remember, what a difference there was in the last
Punic war between Marcus Minucius, the master of the
horse, and Quintus Fabius Maximus, the dictator. The accuser,
therefore, would soon know, that any defence, on the
part of Paullus, would be superfluous.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i38" name="i38"></a>38</span>
&#8220;Let us now pass to the other assembly; and here I
am not to address you as citizens, but as soldiers, if, indeed,
this name can cause a blush, and inspire you with shame, for
your injurious treatment of your general. And I for my part
feel my own mind affected in a very different manner, when I
suppose myself speaking to an army, from what it was, just now,
when my speech was addressed to the commons of the city.
For what say you, soldiers, is there any man in Rome, except
Perseus, that wishes there should be no triumph over Macedon;
and are you not tearing him in pieces with the same
hands with which you subdued the Macedonians? That man,
who would hinder you from entering the city in triumph,
would, if it had been in his power, have hindered you from
conquering. Soldiers, you are mistaken, if you imagine that
a triumph is an honour to the general only, and not to the
soldiers also, as well as to the whole Roman people. This
honour does not belong to Paullus alone. Many who failed
of obtaining a triumph from the senate, have triumphed on
the Alban Mount, No man can wrest from Lucius Paullus
the honour of having brought the Macedonian war to a conclusion,
any more than he can from Caius Lutatius, that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2162" id="Page_2162">Pg 2162</a></span>
putting an end to the first Punic war, or from Publius Cornelius,
that of finishing the second; or from those who, <i>since
those generals</i>, have triumphed. Neither will a triumph add
to, or diminish, the honour of Lucius Paullus as a commander:
the character of the soldiers, and of the whole Roman people,
is more immediately concerned therein, lest they should incur
the imputation of envy and ingratitude towards one of their
most illustrious citizens, and appear to imitate, in this respect,
the Athenians, who have persecuted their distinguished men
by exciting the hatred of the populace. Sufficient error was
committed by your ancestors in the case of Camillus, whom
they treated injuriously, before the city was recovered from
the Gauls through his means; error sufficient, and more than
sufficient, was committed by you in the case of Publius Africanus.
How must we blush, when we reflect that the habitation
and house of the conqueror of Africa was at Liternum;
that his tomb is shown at Liternum! And shall Lucius
Paullus, equal to any of those men in renown, receive from
you an equal share of ill-treatment? Let then this infamy be
first blotted out, which is shameful in the eyes of other nations,
and injurious to ourselves; for who will wish to resemble
either Africanus, or Paullus, in a state ungrateful and inimical
to the virtuous? If there were no disgrace in the case, and the
question merely concerned glory, what triumph does not
imply the general glory of the Roman race? Are all the
numerous triumphs over the Gauls, the Spaniards, and the
Carthaginians, called the triumphs of the generals only, or of
the Roman people? As the triumphs were celebrated not
merely over Pyrrhus, or Hannibal, or Philip, but over the
Epirotes and Carthaginians; so it was not the individual,
Manius Curius, or Publius Cornelius, nor Titus Quinctius,
but the Romans, that triumphed. This, indeed, is the peculiar
case of the soldiers, who, themselves both crowned with
laurel, and conspicuous for the presents each one has received,
proclaim the triumph by name, and march in procession
through the city, singing their own and their commander&#8217;s
praises. If, at any time, soldiers are not brought home from
a province to such honours, they murmur; and yet, even in
that case, they consider themselves distinguished, even in their
absence, because by their hands the victory was obtained. Soldiers,
if it should be asked, for what purpose you were brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2163" id="Page_2163">Pg 2163</a></span>
home to Italy, and not disbanded immediately, when the
business of the province was finished; why you came to Rome,
in a body, round your standards; why you loiter here, and do
not repair to your several homes: what other answer can you
give, than that you wished to be seen triumphing? And, certainly,
you have a right to show yourselves as conquerors.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i39" name="i39"></a>39</span>
&#8220;Triumphs have been lately celebrated over Philip,
father of the present king, and over Antiochus. Both these
triumphs over them took place when they were in possession
of their thrones, and shall there be no triumph over Perseus,
who has been taken prisoner, and, with his children, brought
away to the city? But if Lucius Paullus, as a private citizen,
should, amid the crowd of gowned citizens, interrogate, from the
lower ground, those mounting to the Capitol in a chariot, and
clad in gold and purple,&mdash;&#8216;Lucius Anicius, Cneius Octavius,
whether do you esteem yourselves, or me, more deserving of a
triumph?&#8217; I am confident they would yield him the chariot,
and, through shame, themselves present to him their ensigns
of honour. And do ye choose, citizens, that Gentius should
be led in procession, rather than Perseus; do you wish to
triumph over an accessary, rather than over the principal in
the war? Shall the legions from Illyria, and the crews of the
fleet, enter the city with laurel crowns; and shall the Macedonian
legions, after being refused a triumph, be only spectators
of other men&#8217;s glories? What then will become of such
a rich booty, the spoils of a victory so lucrative? Where
shall be buried so many thousand suits of armour, stripped
from the bodies of the enemy? shall they be sent back to
Macedon? Where shall be lodged the statues of gold, of
marble, and of ivory: the pictures, the tapestries, such a
quantity of wrought silver and gold, and such a mass of
royal money? Shall they be conveyed to the treasury by night,
as if they were stolen? What? when will that greatest
of shows, the celebrated and powerful captive king, Perseus,
be exhibited to the eyes of a victorious people? Most of us
remember what a concourse the captured king Syphax, an
auxiliary only in the Punic war, caused; and shall the captured
king, Perseus, with his sons, Philip and Alexander,
names so illustrious, be withdrawn from the eager gaze of the
state? All men are eagerly anxious to behold Lucius Paullus
himself, twice consul, the conqueror of Greece, entering the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2164" id="Page_2164">Pg 2164</a></span>
city in his triumphal chariot. We made him consul for this
very purpose, that he should finish a war which had been
protracted for four years, to our great shame. When he
obtained that province by lot, and when he was setting out
for it, with presaging minds, we destined to him victory and
triumph; and shall we now, when he is victorious, refuse him
a triumph; shall we defraud, not only men, but the gods also
of the honours due to them? For a triumph is due to the gods
also, and not to men only: your ancestors commenced every
business of importance with worshipping them, and ended all
in the same manner. The consul, or pr&aelig;tor, (when going to
his province and to a war, dressed in his military robe, and
attended by his lictors,) offers vows in the Capitol; and when
he returns victorious, after bringing the war to a conclusion,
carries in triumph to the Capitol, to the deities to whom he
made the vows, the due offering of the Roman people. The
victims that precede him are not the most immaterial part of
the procession,&mdash;to demonstrate that the commander comes
home with thanksgivings to the gods for the success granted
to the state. You may slay at sacrifices performed by different
persons, all those victims, which he has claimed to be led
in his triumph. Do you intend to interrupt those banquets
of the senate which (whether they are meant for the gratification
of men, or both of gods and men) are not partaken of
either in any private or even public unconsecrated place, but
only in the Capitol,&mdash;because such is the will of Servius Galba?
Shall the gates be shut against the triumph of Lucius Paullus?
Shall Perseus, king of Macedon, with his children, the
multitude of other captives, and the spoils of the Macedonians,
be left behind on this side of the river? Shall Lucius Paullus,
in a private character, go straight from the gate to his
house, as if returning home from his country-seat? And do
you, centurion, and you, soldiers, listen to the votes of the
senate respecting your general, Paullus, rather than to what
Servius Galba may invent? Listen to me, who say this, rather
than to him. He has learned nothing, but to speak; and even
that with rancour and malice. I have three-and-twenty times
fought against the enemy, on challenges; from every one with
whom I engaged, I brought off spoils. I have my body
plentifully marked with honourable scars, all received in
front.&#8221; It is said that he then stripped himself, and mentioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2165" id="Page_2165">Pg 2165</a></span>
in what war each of his wounds was received; while
he was showing these, he happened to uncover what ought to
be concealed, and a swelling in his groins raised a laugh among
those near him. He then said, &#8220;This too, which excites your
laughter, I got by continuing days and nights on horseback;
nor do I feel either shame or sorrow for it, any more than for
these scars, since it never prevented me from rendering
effectual service to the republic, either in peace or war. An
aged soldier, I have shown to youthful soldiers this body of
mine, often wounded by the weapons of the enemy. Let
Galba expose his, which is sleek and unhurt. Tribunes, be
pleased to call back the tribes to vote. Soldiers, I<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> <i>will go
down among you, and will follow you as you proceed to give
your votes, and I will mark the turbulent and ungrateful, and
such as require that they should not be governed by the general,
but that he should become their willing slave, through a desire
to gain popularity.&#8221; The great body of the soldiers felt so
deeply the justice of this reproof, that they changed their
minds, so that all the tribes, when recalled to give their votes,
passed unanimously the bill concerning the triumph. Therefore
Paullus, having at length overcome the malice and detraction
of his enemies, celebrated a triumph over king Perseus
and the Macedonians, which lasted three days, namely, the
fourth, third, and second days, before the calends of December.
This triumph, whether we consider the greatness of the conquered
king, or the appearances of the images, or the quantity
of money, was by far the most magnificent that was ever celebrated,
so that by its greatness it precluded all comparison with
occurrences of a similar nature. The people having raised
stands, like those in the theatre, along the market-place and the
other streets of the city, by which the procession was to move,
were spectators, and were dressed in white gowns. All the temples
were open, and were wreathed with garlands and smoking
with incense. The lictors and beadles kept the whole extent of the
streets clear, and the way open, by removing from the middle of
them the mob, which was crowding together and wandering about.</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2166" id="Page_2166">Pg 2166</a></span>
<i>Although the gorgeous spectacle was destined to occupy three
days, as we have already mentioned, yet the first day scarcely
sufficed for the procession of the statues and paintings, which
were placed on two hundred and fifty chariots. The next day
all the most beautiful and most magnificent arms of the Macedonians
were carried along on many waggons; and these arms
were glittering with all the brightness of steel, or lately polished
brass, and were piled up in such a manner with regard to one
another, that although they seemed to be heaped up in masses
rather than artificially arranged, yet they presented to the eye
a striking appearance, owing to this very fortuitous and confused
arrangement: helmets were mixed with shields, and
coats of mail with greaves, and Cretan targets, and Thracian
bucklers, and quivers, in one heap with the bridles of horses,
and naked swords exposing their threatening points, and
Macedonian spears projecting from the sides. And as all
these arms were loosely bound together, whenever they clashed
with one another in the carriage, they sent forth a certain
terrible and martial sound, so that not even the arms of the
conquered could be viewed without a feeling of fear. Then
more than seven hundred and fifty vases, filled with coined
silver, were borne along by three thousand men. Each vase
contained three talents, and was borne by four men. There
were some who bore silver bowls, and goblets, and cups, and
vessels made of horn, remarkable as well for the beauty of
their arrangement, as for their size and weight, and the surpassing
workmanship of the raised carving. On the third day,
at the very dawn, the trumpeters began the march, playing
not only the festal strains which were usual in solemn processions,
but also sounding the war-notes, as if they were
advancing to battle. A hundred and twenty fat oxen with
gilded horns, and adorned with fillets and wreaths of flowers,
were led along. Young men, begirt with bands of exquisite
workmanship, led the bulls along; and to them were added as
companions, boys who bore golden and silver goblets. Then
followed the persons who bore the coined gold in seventy-seven
vases, each of which contained three talents, like those in which
the silver was carried. Then was seen the sacred goblet, ten
talents in weight, adorned with precious gems, which Paullus
had ordered to be made, and also the goblets of Antigonus and
Seleucus, and the cups made by Thericles, and other distinguished</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2167" id="Page_2167">Pg 2167</a></span>
<i>artists, all made of gold, with to which the saloons of
Perseus had been furnished. After them came the chariot of
Perseus, laden with his arms, and a diadem in addition. A
band of captives followed, namely, Bethys, the son of king Cotys,
who had been sent by his father into Macedon as a hostage,
and subsequently taken by the Romans along with the children
of Perseus; then the children of Perseus themselves, accompanied
by a band of tutors and guardians, who in tears
stretched forth their hands mournfully to the spectators, and
instructed the boys to implore suppliantly the mercy of the
victorious people. There were two sons and one daughter
who excited the greater commiseration in the spectators,
because they themselves, on account of their age, could scarcely
comprehend their misfortunes. Therefore the majority of the
spectators could not refrain from tears, and a sort of silent
grief saddened the minds of all, and prevented them from enjoying
real pleasure, as long as the children met their gaze.
Behind his children walked Perseus with his wife, in a mourning
robe, dressed in sandals, after the Greek custom, like a
person stupified and astonished, whom the greatness of his
calamities seemed to have deprived of reason. Then followed
a crowd of friends and acquaintances, in whose countenances
deep grief was depicted, for whenever they gazed on the king
they wept bitterly, demonstrating clearly that they were grieved
on account of his calamities, but forgot their own. Perseus
had endeavoured to avert this ignominy by entreaties, and had
sent persons to &AElig;milius, to beg that he should not be led in the
triumphal procession. &AElig;milius smiled at the dastardly spirit
of the wretch, and said, &#8220;that this request was formerly, and
is even now, under his own actions and power;&#8221; thereby giving
him a silent hint, that he should avoid by a noble death that of
which he was afraid. But his irresolute mind was not capable
of adopting so determined a design, and under the soothing
influence of some hope, he preferred being considered part of
his own spoil. Then four hundred golden crowns were carried
along, which had been sent by almost all the states of
Greece and Asia, through their ambassadors, as gifts to Paullus,
and an expression of their joy for his victory: their value, if
they were considered intrinsically, was immense, yet they constituted
a slight addition to the enormous treasures which were
borne in that triumph.</i></p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i40" name="i40"></a>40</span>
Valerius Antias tells us, that the total of the captured
gold and silver, carried in the procession, was one hundred
and twenty millions of sesterces;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> but from the number of
chariots, and the weights of the gold and silver, specifically
set down by himself, the amount is unquestionably made much
greater. An equal sum, it is said, had been either expended on
the late war, or dissipated during the flight, when he sought
Samothrace; and it was more wonderful on this account, because
so large a quantity of money had been amassed within
the space of the thirty years that intervened since Philip&#8217;s war
with the Romans, partly out of the produce of the mines, and
partly from the other branches of revenue. Philip began war
against the Romans almost destitute of money; Perseus, on the
contrary, was immensely rich. Last came Paullus himself, in
his chariot, making a very majestic appearance, both from the
dignity of his person, and from his age. After his chariot,
among other illustrious personages, were his two sons, Quintus
Maximus and Publius Scipio; then the cavalry, troop by troop,
and the cohorts of infantry, each in its order. The donative
distributed among them was one hundred denariuses<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> to each
footman, double to a centurion, and triple to a horseman; and
it is believed that he would have given as much more to the
infantry, and in the same proportion to the others, had they
not objected to his attaining the present honour, or had they
answered with thankful acclamations, when that sum was announced
as their reward. But Perseus, led through the city of
his enemies in chains, before the chariot of the general, his conqueror,
was not the only instance at the time of the misfortunes
incident to mankind; another appeared even in the victorious
Paullus, though glittering in gold and purple. For, of two
sons, (whom, after having given away two others on adoption,
he had retained at home, the sole heirs of his name, household
gods, and estate,) the younger, about twelve years old, died five
days before the triumph, and the elder fourteen years of age,
three days after it; who ought to have been carried in the
chariot with their father, dressed in the pr&aelig;texta, and anticipating,
in their hopes, the like kind of honours for themselves.
A few days after, at a general assembly granted
by Marcus Antonius, tribune of the people, after Paullus
has descanted on his own proper services, as usually done
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2169" id="Page_2169">Pg 2169</a></span>by other commanders, his speech was memorable, and worthy
of a Roman chief.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i41" name="i41"></a>41</span>
&#8220;Although, Romans, I think you are not ignorant that
I have successfully administered the state, nor that two dreadful
strokes have lately crushed my house; since now my
triumph and now the funerals of my two sons have been exhibited
to your view; yet permit me, I pray you, to take in few
words, and with that temper which becomes me, a comparative
view of my own private situation, and the happy state of
the public. Departing from Italy, I sailed from Brundusium
at sun-rise; at the ninth hour, with my whole squadron, I
reached Corcyra. On the fifth day after that I offered sacrifice
to Apollo, at Delphi, in expiation of myself, of your armies
and fleets. From Delphi I arrived on the fifth day in the
camp; where, having received the command of the army, and
altered several matters which greatly impeded success, I
advanced into the country; as the enemy&#8217;s camp was impregnable,
and Perseus could not be brought to an action, I forced
the pass of Petra in the very face of his guards, and at length,
compelled the king to come to an engagement, and gained a
complete victory. I reduced Macedonia under the power of
the Romans; and in fifteen days finished a war, which four
consuls before me had for four years conducted in such a
manner, that each left it to his successor more formidable
than he had found it. Other prosperous events followed in
consequence of this; all the cities of Macedon submitted;
the royal treasure came into my hands; the king himself,
with his children, was taken in the temple of Samothrace,
just as if the gods themselves delivered him into my hands.
I now thought my good fortune excessive, and on that
account to be suspected; I began to dread the dangers of the
sea in carrying away the king&#8217;s vast treasure, and transporting
the victorious army. When all arrived in Italy, after a
prosperous voyage, and I had nothing further to wish, I
prayed that (as fortune generally from the highest elevation
rolls backwards) my own house, rather than the commonwealth,
might feel the change. I hope, therefore, that the
republic is free from danger, by my having undergone such
an extraordinary calamity, as to have my triumph, in mockery
as it were of human fortunes, intervene between the funerals
of my two sons. And though Perseus and myself are at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2170" id="Page_2170">Pg 2170</a></span>
present exhibited as the most striking examples of the vicissitudes
of mortals, yet he,&mdash;who, himself in captivity saw
his children led captive,&mdash;has them still in safety; while I
who triumphed over him, went up in my chariot to the
Capitol from the funeral of one son, and came down from the
Capitol to the bed of the other, just expiring; nor out of so
large a family of children is there one remaining to bear the
name of Lucius &AElig;milius Paullus. For, as out of a numerous
progeny, the Cornelian and Fabian families have two of them
who were given in adoption. In the house of Paullus, except
the old man, none remains. However, your happiness, and
the prosperous state of the commonwealth, console me for this
ruin of my house.&#8221; 42. These words, expressed with such
magnanimity, moved the minds of the audience with deeper
commiseration than if he had with tears bewailed the loss of
his children in the most plaintive terms.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i42" name="i42"></a>42</span>
Cneius Octavius celebrated a naval triumph over king
Perseus, on the calends of December. That triumph was
without prisoners or spoils. He distributed to each seaman
seventy-five denariuses;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> to the pilots who were on board,
twice that sum; and to the masters of ships, four times. A
meeting of the senate was then held. The fathers ordered
that Quintus Cassius should conduct king Perseus
and his son Alexander to Alba, to be there kept in custody;
but that he should retain his attendants, money, plate, and
furniture. Bitis, son to the king of Thrace, was sent to
Carseoli; with the hostages he had given to Macedon, the rest,
who had been led in triumph, were ordered to be shut up in
prison. A few days after this passed, ambassadors came from
Cotys, king of Thrace, bringing money to ransom his son and
the said hostages. When they were introduced to an audience
of the senate, and alleged, as an argument, in excuse of
Cotys, that he had not voluntarily assisted Perseus in the war,
but had been compelled to do it; and likewise requested the
senate to allow the hostages to be ransomed, at any price that
should be judged proper; the following answer was returned
to them: that &#8220;the Roman people remembered the friendship
which had subsisted between them and Cotys, and likewise
his predecessors, and the Thracian nation; that the giving of
hostages was the very fault laid to his charge, and not an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2171" id="Page_2171">Pg 2171</a></span>apology for it; for Perseus, even when at rest from others,
could not be formidable to the Thracian nation, much less when
he was embroiled in a war with Rome. But that notwithstanding
that Cotys had preferred the favour of Perseus to the
friendship of the Roman people, yet the senate would consider
rather what suited their own dignity, than what treatment he
had merited; and would send home his son and the hostages;
that the kind acts of the Roman people were always gratuitous,
and that they chose to leave the value of them in the memory
of the receivers, rather than to demand it at the time.&#8221; Titus
Quintius Flamininus, Caius Licinius Nerva, and Marcus Caninius
Rebilus were nominated ambassadors to conduct the
hostages to Thrace; and a present of two thousand <i>asses</i><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> was
made to each of the Thracian ambassadors. Bithys was fetched
from Carseoli, and, accompanied by the hostages, was sent to
his father along with the ambassadors. Some of the king&#8217;s
ships which were taken from the Macedonians, which were of a
size never seen before, were hauled ashore in the field of Mars.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i43" name="i43"></a>43</span>
While the memory of the Macedonian triumph was
remaining not only in the minds but almost before the eyes
of the people, Lucius Anicius triumphed over king Gentius
and the Illyrians, on the day of the festival of Quirinus.
These exhibitions were considered rather as similar than equal.
The commander himself was inferior; Anicius was not to be
compared in renown with &AElig;milius; a pr&aelig;tor, in dignity of
office, with a consul; neither could Gentius be set on a level
with Perseus, nor the Illyrians with the Macedonians; nor
the spoils, nor the money, nor the presents obtained in one
country, with those obtained in the other. But though the
late triumph outshone the present, yet the latter, when considered
by itself, appeared very far from contemptible. For
Anicius had, in the space of a few days, entirely subdued the
Illyrian nation, though they were remarkable for their courage
both on land and sea, and confident in the strength of their
position; he had also taken their king and the whole royal
family. He carried in his triumph many military standards,
and much spoil of other sorts, with all the royal furniture;
and also twenty-seven pounds&#8217; weight of gold, and nineteen of
silver, besides three thousand denariuses,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and, in Illyrian
money, the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2172" id="Page_2172">Pg 2172</a></span>Before his chariot were led Gentius, with his queen and children;
Caravantius, the king&#8217;s brother, and several Illyrian nobles.
Out of the booty he gave forty-five denariuses<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> to each
footman, double that sum to a centurion, triple it to a horseman;
to the Latin allies the like sums as to natives, and to the
seamen the same as to the soldiers. The soldiers attended this
triumph with greater demonstrations of joy than that of &AElig;milius,
and the general was celebrated in abundance of songs.
Valerius Antias says, that twenty thousand sesterces<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> were
produced by the sale of the booty, besides the gold and silver
carried to the treasury; but, as no sources appeared from which
such a sum could be raised, I have set down my authority instead
of asserting the fact. King Gentius, with his queen,
children, and brother, was, pursuant to an order of the senate
taken to Spoletium, to be kept there in custody; the rest of the
prisoners were thrown into prison at Rome; but the people of
Spoletium refusing the charge, the royal family was removed
to Iguvium. There remained of the Illyrian spoil, two hundred
and twenty barks, which Quintus Cassius, by order of the
senate, distributed among the Corcyreans, Apollonians, and
Dyrrachians.</p>

<p><span class="lsidenote"><a id="i44" name="i44"></a>44</span>
The consuls of this year, after merely ravaging the lands
of the Ligurians, as the enemy never brought an army into
the field, returned to Rome to elect new magistrates, without
having performed any matter of importance; and on the first
day on which the assembly could meet, they appointed Marcus
Claudius Marcellus, and Caius Sulpicius Gallus, consuls.
Lucius Livius, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, Aulus Licinius
Nerva, Publius Rutilius Calvus, Publius Quintilius Varus,
and Marcus Fonteius, were elected pr&aelig;tors on the next day.
The two city provinces, the two Spains, Sicily, and Sardinia
were decreed to these pr&aelig;tors. There was an intercalation
made in the calendar this year, which took place on the day
after the feast of Terminus. One of the augurs, Caius Claudius,
died this year, and Titus Quintus Flamininus was chosen
in his place by the college. The flamen quirinalis, Quintus
Fabius Pictor, died also. This year king Prusias arrived at
Rome with his son Nicomedes. Coming into the city with a
large retinue, he went directly from the gate to the forum, to
the tribunal of the pr&aelig;tor, Quintus Cassius; and a crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2173" id="Page_2173">Pg 2173</a></span>
immediately collecting, he said, that &#8220;he came to pay his respects
to the deities inhabiting the city of Rome, and to the
Roman senate and people, to congratulate them on their
conquest of the two kings, Perseus and Gentius, and the
augmentation of their empire by the reduction of Macedon
and Illyria under their dominion.&#8221; When the pr&aelig;tor told him
that, if he chose it, he would procure him audience of the senate
on the same day, he desired two days&#8217; time, in which he might
go round and visit the temples of the gods, see the city, and
his acquaintances and friends. Lucius Cornelius Scipio, then
qu&aelig;stor, who had been sent to Capua to meet him, was appointed
to conduct him around Rome. A house was likewise provided,
capable of lodging him and his retinue with convenience.
On the third day after, he attended at a meeting of the senate.
He congratulated them on their success, recounted his own deserts
towards them during the war, and then requested that
&#8220;he might be allowed to fulfil a vow of sacrificing ten large
victims in the Capitol, and one to Fortune at Pr&aelig;neste; a
vow which had been made for the success of the Roman people.
He further desired that the alliance with him might be
renewed; and that the territory taken from king Antiochus,
and not granted to any other, but now in possession of the
Gauls, might be given to him.&#8221; Lastly, he recommended to
the senate his son Nicomedes. He was assisted by the interest
of all those who had commanded armies in Macedon; his requests
therefore were granted, except that with regard to the
territory, concerning which he received this answer: that
&#8220;they would send ambassadors to examine the matter on the
spot. If the territory in question had become the property of
the Roman people, and if no grant had been made of it, they
would deem no other so deserving of a present of the kind as
Prusias. But if it had not belonged to Antiochus, it evidently,
in consequence, did not become the property of the Roman
people; or if it had been already granted to the Gauls, Prusias
must excuse the Roman people if they did not choose to confer
a present on him in violation of the rights of others. A
present cannot be acceptable to the receiver, which he knows
the donor may take away whenever he thinks proper. That
they cheerfully accepted his recommendation of Nicomedes;
and Ptolemy, king of Egypt, was an instance of the great care
with which the Roman people supported the children of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2174" id="Page_2174">Pg 2174</a></span>
friends.&#8221; With this answer Prusias was dismissed. Presents
were ordered to be given him to the value of * * * * sesterces
besides vases of silver, weighing fifty pounds. And they
voted that gifts should be given to his son Nicomedes of the
same value with those given to Masgaba, the son of king
Masinissa; and that the same victims, and other matters pertaining
to sacrifices, should be furnished to the king at the public
expense, as to the Roman magistrates, whenever he chose to
make the offering, either at Rome or at Pr&aelig;neste; and that
twenty ships of war should be assigned to him, and which
were then lying at Brundusium, of which he should have the
use until he arrived at the fleet which was presented to him.
That Lucius Cornelius Scipio should not quit him, but defray
all his expenses, and those of his retinue, until they went on
board the ships. We are told that Prusias was wonderfully
rejoiced at the kind treatment which he received from the
Roman people; that he refused all that had been offered to
himself, but ordered his son to receive the present of the Roman
people. Such are the accounts given of Prusias by our
own writers. Polybius, however, represents that king as
having degraded the majesty of his name,&mdash;and says that he
used to meet the ambassadors, wearing a cap, and having his
head shaved, calling himself a freed slave of the Roman
people, and, accordingly, bearing the badges of that class; that
likewise at Rome, when coming into the senate-house, he
stooped down and kissed the threshold; called the senate his
tutelar deities, and used other expressions not so honourable
to the hearers as disgraceful to himself. He staid in the city
and its vicinity not more than thirty days, and then returned
to his kingdom, and the war that had been carried on in Asia.

<h3><a name="bk46" id="bk46"></a>BOOK XLVI.</h3>

<p>King Eumenes came to Rome. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 586. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 166.] A general
law was introduced, that no king should be permitted to come to
Rome, in order that he might not appear to be declared an enemy,
if he were excluded; nor yet justified, if he were admitted&mdash;because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2175" id="Page_2175">Pg 2175</a></span>
he had remained neutral in the Macedonian war. The consul,
Claudius Marcellus, subdued the Alpine Gauls; and Caius Sulpicius
Gallus the Ligurians. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 587. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 165.] The ambassadors
of king Prusias complain of Eumenes, for ravaging their borders;
they accuse him of entering into a conspiracy, with Antiochus,
against the Romans. A treaty of friendship was made with the
Rhodians, upon their solicitation, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 588. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 164.] A census
was held by the censors; the number of the citizens was found to be
three hundred and twenty-seven thousand and twenty-two. Marcus
&AElig;milius Lepidus was chosen chief of the senate. Ptolemy, king
of Egypt, being dethroned by his younger brother, was restored by
ambassadors sent from Rome. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 589. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 163.] Ariarathes,
king of Cappadocia, died, and was succeeded by his son Ariarathes,
who entered anew into a treaty of friendship with the Romans.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 590. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 162.] Expeditions against the Ligurians, Corsicans,
and Lusitanians, were attended with various success. Commotions
took place in Syria, on occasion of the death of Antiochus, who had
left a son, an infant; Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, who had been
a hostage at Rome, secretly murders this young Antiochus, with
his tutor Lysias, because he was not dismissed by the Romans, and
usurps the kingdom, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 591. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 161.] Lucius &AElig;milius Paullus,
the conqueror of Perseus, died. Such was the moderation and
integrity of this great commander, that, notwithstanding the
immense treasures he had brought from Spain and Macedon,
upon the sale of his effects, there could scarcely be raised a sum
sufficient to repay his wife&#8217;s fortune, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 592. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 160.] The
Pomptine marshes were drained, and converted into dry land, by
the consul, Cornelius Cethegus.</p>

<p>Cneius Tremellius, a plebeian tribune, was [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 593. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 159]
fined for contending in an unjust cause with Marcus &AElig;milius
Lepidus, the chief priest; which greatly enhanced the authority of
the priesthood. A law was made respecting the canvassing for
offices, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 594. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 158.] A census was held: the number of
Roman citizens was found to be three hundred and twenty-eight
thousand three hundred and fourteen. Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus
was again chosen chief of the senate. A treaty was concluded
between the Ptolemies, brothers, that one should be the king of
Egypt, the other of Cyrene. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 595. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 157.] Ariarathes, king
of Cappadocia, being deprived of his kingdom by the intrigues and
power of Demetrius, king of Syria, was restored by the senate.
Ambassadors were sent by the senate to determine a territorial dispute
between Masinissa and the Carthaginians, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 596. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
156.] Caius Marcius, the consul, fought against the Dalmatians, at
first unfortunately; but afterwards successfully. The cause of this
war was, that they had made inroads upon the Illyrians, who were
in alliance with the people of Rome. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 597. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 155.] The
Dalmatians were subdued by the consul, Cornelius Nasica. The
consul, Quintus Opimius, defeats the Transalpine Ligurians, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2176" id="Page_2176">Pg 2176</a></span>
had plundered Antipolis and Nic&aelig;a, two towns belonging to the
Massilians. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 598. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 154.] Various ill successes occurred
under different commanders, in Spain. In the five hundred and
ninety-eighth year from the foundation of the city, the consuls
enter upon office immediately after the conclusion of their election;
which alteration was made on account of a rebellion in Spain.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 599. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 153.] The ambassadors sent by the senate to
determine a dispute between Masinissa and the Carthaginians
return, and report that the Carthaginians had collected a vast
quantity of materials for ship-building. Several pr&aelig;tors, accused
of extortion by different provinces, were condemned and punished.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk48" id="bk48"></a>BOOK XLVIII.</h3>

<p>A census was held by the censors [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 600. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 152]; the
number of citizens amounted to three hundred and twenty-four
thousand. The causes of the third Punic war are enumerated:
when a large army of Numidians was said to be in the territory of
the Carthaginians, with Ariobarzanes, the descendant of Syphax, as
general, Marcus Porcius Cato advised that war should be declared
against the Carthaginians, because they had invited Ariobarzanes
into their country, apparently to oppose king Masinissa, but in
reality against the Romans. Publius Scipio Nasica being of a contrary
opinion, it is resolved to send ambassadors to Carthage, to
inquire into the truth of the affair. The Carthaginian senate being
reproved for levying forces, and preparing materials for ship-building,
contrary to treaty, declare themselves ready to make
peace with Masinissa, upon condition of his giving up the lands in
dispute. But Gisgo, son of Hamilcar, a man of a seditious disposition,
at that time chief magistrate, notwithstanding the determination
of the senate to abide by the decision of the ambassadors,
urges the Carthaginians to war against the Romans, in such strong
terms, that the ambassadors are obliged to save themselves by
flight from personal violence. On this being announced at Rome,
the senate becomes more highly incensed against them. Cato, being
poor, celebrated the funeral obsequies of his son, who died in the
office of pr&aelig;tor, at a very small expense. Andriscus, an impostor,
pretending to be the son of Perseus, king of Macedonia, was sent to
Rome. Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus, who had been six times declared
chief of the senate, on his death-bed, gives strict orders to his sons
that he shall be carried out to burial on a couch, without the usual
ornaments of purple and fine linen, and that there shall not be
expended on his funeral more than ten pieces of brass: alleging
that the funerals of the most distinguished men used, formerly, to
be decorated by trains of images, and not by vast expense. An
inquiry was instituted concerning poisoning. Publicia and Licinia,
women of high rank, accused of the murder of their husbands,
were tried before the pr&aelig;tor, and executed, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 601.
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 151.] Gulussa, son of Masinissa, gives information that troops
were levying and a fleet fitting out at Carthage, and that there
could be no doubt of their intending war. Cato urging a declaration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2177" id="Page_2177">Pg 2177</a></span>
of war, and Nasica speaking against it, entreated the senate to
do nothing rashly; it is resolved to send ten ambassadors to inquire
into the affair. The consuls, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, and Aulus
Postumius Albinus, carrying on the levying of soldiers with inflexible
severity, were committed to prison by the tribunes of the
people, for not, at their entreaty, sparing some of their friends.
The ill success of the war in Spain having so discouraged the
citizens of Rome, that none could be found to undertake any
military command or office, Publius Cornelius &AElig;milianus comes
forward, and offers to undertake any office whatever, which it
should be thought proper to call him to: roused by his example,
the whole body of the people make the like offer. It was thought
that the consul, Claudius Marcellus, had reduced all the states of
Celtiberia to a state of tranquillity; nevertheless, his successor,
Lucius Lucullus, is engaged in war with the Vaccosans, Cantabrians,
and other nations of Spaniards, hitherto unknown; all of
which he subdues. In this war, Publius Cornelius Africanus
Scipio &AElig;milianus, the son of Lucius Paullus, and nephew, by
adoption, of Africanus, a military tribune, slays a barbarian who
had challenged him, and distinguishes himself highly at the siege of
Intercatia; being the first who scaled the wall. The pr&aelig;tor, Servius
Sulpicius Galba, fights against the Lusitanians unsuccessfully.
When the ambassadors, returning from Africa, together with some
Carthaginian deputies, and Gulussa, reported that they found an
army and a fleet ready for service at Carthage, the matter was
taken into consideration by the senate. Cato, and other principal
Senators, urge that an army should be immediately sent over into
Africa; but Cornelius Nasica declaring that he yet saw no just
cause for war, it is resolved that it should not be declared, provided
the Carthaginians would burn their fleet, and disband
their troops; but if not, that then the next succeeding consuls
should propose the question of war. A theatre which the censors
had contracted for, being built, Cornelius Nasica moves, and
carries the question, that it be pulled down, as being not only useless,
but injurious to the morals of the people: the people, therefore,
continue to behold the public shows standing. Masinissa,
now ninety-two years old, vanquishes the Carthaginians, who had
made war against him unjustly, and contrary to treaty. By this
infraction of the treaty, they also involve themselves in a war with
Rome.</p>

<h3><a name="bk49" id="bk49"></a>BOOK XLIX.</h3>

<p>The commencement of the third Punic war, dated [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 602.
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 150], which was ended within five years after it began. Marcus
Porcius Cato, deemed the wisest man in the state, and Scipio
Nasica, adjudged by the senate to be the best, differ in opinion, and
have a sharp altercation: Cato urging the demolition of Carthage;
Nasica arguing against it. It was, however, resolved, that war should
be declared against the Carthaginians, for having fitted out a fleet
contrary to treaty, and led forth an army beyond the boundaries of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2178" id="Page_2178">Pg 2178</a></span>
their state; for having committed hostilities against Masinissa the
friend and ally of the Romans; and refusing to admit Gulussa, who
accompanied the ambassadors into their city. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 603. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 149.]
Before any forces were embarked, ambassadors came from Utica,
and surrendered their state and property to the Romans: an
ominous circumstance highly pleasing to the Roman senate, and
at the same time a grievous mortification to the Carthaginians.
Games were exhibited at Tarentum, in honour of Pluto, according
to directions found in the Sibylline books, the same as had been
celebrated a hundred years before, during the first Punic war.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 502.] The Carthaginians send thirty ambassadors to Rome
to make a tender of submission; but the opinion of Cato, that the
consuls should be ordered to proceed immediately to the war
prevails. These, passing over into Africa, receive three hundred
hostages, and take possession of all the arms and warlike stores to
be found in Carthage; they then, by authority of the senate, command
them to build themselves a new city, at least ten miles from
the sea. Roused by this indignant treatment, the Carthaginians
resolve to have recourse to arms. Lucius Marcius and Marcus
Manlius, consuls, lay siege to Carthage. During this siege, two
military tribunes force their way in, with their troops, in a place
which they observed to be negligently guarded; they are set upon
and beaten by the townsmen, but rescued afterwards by Scipio
Africanus, who also, with a few horsemen, relieves a Roman fort,
attacked by the enemy in the night. He also repulsed the Carthaginians,
who sallied forth in great force to attack the camp. When,
afterwards, one of the consuls (the other having gone to Rome to
hold the elections) observed that the siege of Carthage was not
going on prosperously, and proposed to attack Hasdrubal, who had
drawn up his forces in a narrow pass, he (Scipio) first advised him
not to venture upon an engagement on ground so very disadvantageous:
and then, when his advice was overruled by those who
were envious both of his prudence and valour, he himself rushed
into the pass; and when the Romans were routed and put to flight,
as he foresaw would take place, he returns with a very small body
of horse, rescues his friends, and brings them off in safety. Which
valiant action, Cato, although much more inclined to censure than
to praise, extols in the senate in very magnificent terms: saying that
all the others, who were fighting in Africa, were but mere shadows;
Scipio was life itself: and such was the favour he gained among his
fellow-citizens, that at the ensuing election the greater number of
the tribes voted for electing him consul, although he was under the
legal age. Lucius Scribonius, tribune of the people, proposes a law,
that the Lusitanians, who, notwithstanding they had surrendered
upon the faith of the Roman people, had been sold in Gaul, by
Servius Galba, should be restored to liberty; which Marcus Cato
supports with great zeal, as may be seen by his oration, which is
still extant, being published in his annals. Quintus Fulvius Nobilior,
although Cato had before handled him with great severity, yet
takes up the cause of Galba. Galba himself too, apprehensive of
being condemned, taking up in his arms his own two infant children,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2179" id="Page_2179">Pg 2179</a></span>
and the son of Sulpicius Gallus, speaks in his own behalf, in such
a piteous strain of supplication, that the question was carried in
his favour. One Andriscus, a man of the meanest extraction,
having given himself out to be the son of Perseus, and changed his
name to Philip, flies from Rome, whither Demetrius had sent him,
on account of this audacious forgery; many people believing his
fabulous account of himself to be true, gather round him, and
enable him to raise an army; at the head of which, partly by
force, and partly by the willing submission of the people, he
acquires the possession of all Macedon. The story which he
propagated was this: that he was the son of Perseus by a harlot;
that he had been delivered to a certain Cretan woman to be taken
care of, and brought up; in order that whatever might be the event
of the war, in which the king was at that time engaged with the
Romans, some one, at least, of the royal progeny might remain.
That, upon the death of Perseus, he was educated at Adramytteum,
until he was twelve years old; ignorant all along of his real parentage,
and always supposing himself to be the son of the person who
brought him up. That, at length, this person being ill, and about to
die, discovered to him the secret of his birth; informing him at the
same time of a certain writing, sealed with the royal signet of
Perseus, which had been intrusted to his supposed mother, to keep
and give to him, when he should attain to manhood: but with the
strictest injunctions that the affair should be kept a profound
secret until the arrival of that period. That, when the time came,
the writing was delivered to him; in which was indicated a very
considerable treasure, left him by his father. That the woman,
after informing him fully of the circumstance of his birth, earnestly
besought him to quit that part of the country before the affair
should come to the knowledge of Eumenes, the enemy of his father
Perseus, lest he should be murdered. That, fearful of being assassinated,
and in hopes also of receiving some assistance from Demetrius,
he had gone into Syria; and had there first ventured openly
to declare who he was.</p>

<p>The aforesaid impostor [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 604. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 148] assuming the name
of Philip, being about to invade and forcibly possess himself of
Thessaly, was prevented by the Roman ambassadors, with the aid of
the Ach&aelig;ans. Prusias, king of Bithynia, a man abandoned to the
practice of every vice, was murdered by his son Nicomedes, assisted
by Attalus, king of Pergamus. He had another son, who in the
place of teeth in his upper jaw, is said to have had one entire bone.
The Romans send an embassy to negotiate peace between Nicomedes
and Prusias; it happening that one of the ambassadors had
his head deformed by scars, from many wounds; another was lame
from gout, and the third was of weak understanding: Cato said, it
was an embassy without head, feet, or heart. The king of Syria
was of the royal race of Perseus; but being, like Prusias, addicted
to every vicious pursuit, and passing his whole time in tippling-houses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2180" id="Page_2180">Pg 2180</a></span>
brothels, and such like places of infamous resort, Ammonus
rules in his stead; and puts to death all the king&#8217;s friends, together
with his queen Laodice, and Antigonus, the son of Demetrius. Masinissa,
king of Numidia, a man of a character truly illustrious,
dies, aged upwards of ninety years; he retained the vigour of youth
even to his last years; and begot a son at the age of eighty-six.
Publius Scipio &AElig;milianus, being authorized by his will so to do divides
his kingdom into three parts, and allots their respective portions
of it to his three sons, Micipsa, Gulussa, and Manastabal.
Scipio persuades Pham&aelig;as, general of the Carthaginian cavalry,
under Himilco, a man highly looked up to and relied upon by the
Carthaginians, to revolt to the Romans, with the troops under his
command. Claudius Marcellus, one of the three ambassadors sent
to Masinissa, was lost in a storm. Hasdrubal, nephew of Masinissa,
was put to death by the Carthaginians, who suspected him of treasonable
views, on account of his affinity to Gulussa, now the friend of
the Romans. Scipio &AElig;milianus, when a candidate for the &aelig;dileship
was elected consul by the people, though under age: a violent contest
arises from this, the people supporting, the nobles opposing, his
election; which, at length, terminates in his favour. Manius
Manlius takes several citizens in the neighbourhood of Carthage.
The impostor Philip, having slain the pr&aelig;tor, Publius Juventius,
and vanquished his army, was himself afterwards subdued and
taken prisoner by Quintua C&aelig;cilius, who recovered Macedonia.</p>

<p>Carthage, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 605. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 147,] comprehended in a circuit of
twenty-three miles, was besieged with immense exertion, and was
gradually taken; first, by Mancinus, acting as lieutenant-general;
and afterwards by Scipio, the consul, to whom Africa was voted as
his province, without casting lots. The Carthaginians having constructed
a new mole, (the old one being destroyed by Scipio,) and
equipped, secretly, in an unusually short space of time, a considerable
fleet, engage, unsuccessfully, in a sea-fight. Hasdrubal, with
his army, notwithstanding he had taken post in a place of extremely
difficult approach, was cut off by Scipio; who at length took the
city by storm, in the seven hundredth year after its foundation.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 606. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 146.] The greater part of the spoil was returned to
the Sicilians, from whom it had been taken. During the destruction
of the city, when Hasdrubal had given himself up into Scipio&#8217;s
hands, his wife, who, a few days before, had not been able to prevail
upon him to surrender to the conqueror, casts herself, with her
two children, from a tower into the flames of the burning city.
Scipio, following the example of his father, &AElig;milius Paullus, the
conqueror of Macedon, celebrates solemn games; during which he
exposes the deserters and fugitives to wild beasts. The origin of
the Ach&aelig;an war is referred to the circumstance of the ambassadors
of the Romans being expelled from Corinth by the Ach&aelig;ans,
when they were sent to separate from the Ach&aelig;an council those
cities which had been under the dominion of Philip.</p>

<p>Quintus C&aelig;cilius Metellus engages and conquers the Ach&aelig;ans,
together with the B&#339;otians and Chalcidians. Critolaus, their unsuccessful
general, poisons himself; in whose room, the Ach&aelig;ans
choose as general, Di&aelig;us, the chief promoter of the insurrection; he
also is conquered, in an engagement near Isthmos, and all Achaia
reduced; Corinth was demolished, by order of the senate, because
violence had been done there to the ambassadors. Thebes also, and
Chalcis, for having furnished aid to the Ach&aelig;ans, were destroyed.
Lucius Mummius afforded in himself an example of extreme forbearance,
for, having all the vast wealth and splendid ornaments of
the opulent city of Corinth in his power, he took none of them.
Quintus C&aelig;cilius Metellus triumphs, on account of his victory, over
Andriscus; likewise Publius Cornelius Scipio, for the conquest of
Carthage and Hasdrubal. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 607. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 145.] Viriathus, in
Spain, from a shepherd becomes a hunter, then leader of a band of
robbers; afterwards general of a powerful army, with which he
possesses himself of all Lusitania, having vanquished the pr&aelig;tor,
Petilius, and put his army to flight. Caius Plautius, the pr&aelig;tor,
sent against him, is equally unfortunate. So successful was his
career, that, at length, it was deemed necessary to send a consul, at
the head of a consular army, against him. Commotions in Syria,
and wars between the kings in those parts are recorded. Alexander, a
man utterly unknown, and of an unknown race, murders Demetrius,
and usurps the crown in Syria: he is afterwards slain by Demetrius,
(son of the before-mentioned Demetrius,) aided by Ptolemy, king of
Egypt, whose daughter he had married. Ptolemy grievously wounded
in the head; dies of the operations intended for the cure of his
wounds; and is succeeded by his younger brother, Ptolemy, king of
Cyrene. Demetrius, by his cruelty towards his subjects, provokes an
insurrection; is vanquished by Diodotus, and flies to Seleucia, while
Diodotus claims the crown for Alexander, a child scarcely two years
old. Lucius Mummius triumphed over the Ach&aelig;ans, and so carried
in his triumph brazen standards, marble statues, and pictures.</p>

Titus Manlius Torquatus, the father of Silanus, sought and obtained
permission to inquire into the matter. And the case having been
considered at home, he condemned and disowned his son, and did
not even attend his funeral after he had hung himself, but continued
to sit at home, and give audience to those who consulted
him, as if nothing, which concerned him, had happened, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span>

Servilius C&aelig;pio procures the death of Viriathus, by traitors; he is
much bewailed, and interred with distinguished funeral honours by
his army. He was, in truth, a great man, and a valiant general;
and in the fourteen years during which he carried on war with the
Romans, had very frequently vanquished their armies.</p>

<p>While Publius Cornelius Nasica, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 614. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 138,] (who was
nicknamed Scrapio by the plebeian tribune Curiatius, a man of
humour,) and Decius Junius Brutus, the consuls, were holding the
levies, an act of public justice was done, in the sight of the whole
body of the young men then assembled, which afforded a very
useful example: Caius Matienus was accused, before the tribunes,
of deserting from the army in Spain; being found guilty, he was
scourged under the gallows, and sold as a slave, for a sestertius.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
The tribunes of the people claimed the privilege of exempting
from service any ten soldiers whom they thought proper;
on this being refused by the consuls, they commit the latter to
prison. Junius Brutus, the consul in Spain, allots lands, and a
town called Valentia, to the soldiers who had served under Viriathus.
Marcus Popilius, having made peace with the Numantines,
which the senate refused to ratify, was routed, and his whole army
put to flight. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 615. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 137.] While Caius Hostilius Mancinus,
the consul, was sacrificing, the holy chickens escape from
their coop, and fly away; afterwards, as he was getting on board his
ship, to sail for Spain, a voice is heard crying out, &#8220;Go not, Mancinus,
go not.&#8221; The event afterwards proves these omens to have
been inauspicious: for, being vanquished by the Numantines, and
driven out of his camp, when he had no prospect of preserving
his army, he made a disgraceful peace, which the senate likewise
refused to ratify. Upon this occasion thirty thousand Romans
were beaten by only four thousand Numantines. Decius Junius
Brutus subdues all Lusitania, as far as the western sea; and when
his soldiers refused to pass the river Oblivio, he seizes the standard
and carries it over; whereupon they follow him. The son of Alexander,
king of Syria, was traitorously murdered by his guardian

against the Gall&aelig;cians, in Farther Spain: Marcus &AElig;milius Lepidus
engages the Vacc&aelig;ans, unsuccessfully, and is as unfortunate
as Mancinus was against the Numantines. The Romans, to absolve
themselves from the guilt of breach of treaty, order Mancinus,
who made the peace with the Numantines, to be delivered up to
that people; but they refuse to receive him. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 617. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 135.]
The lustrum was closed by the censors: the number of citizens was
three hundred and twenty-three thousand. Fulvius Flaccus, the
consul, subdued the Vardeans in Illyria. Marcus Cosconius, the
pr&aelig;tor, fights against the Scordiscians, in Thrace, and conquers them.
The war in Numantia still continuing, owing to the ill-conduct of the
generals, the senate and people voluntarily confer the consulship
upon Scipio Africanus: on which occasion the law, which prohibits
any man from being elected consul a second time, is dispensed with.

which is committed to the care of the consul, Caius Fulvius, when
the pr&aelig;tor is unable to quell it. Eunus, a slave, a Syrian by birth,
was the author of this war; by gathering a large body of the rustic
slaves, and breaking open the prisons, he raised a considerable
army: Cleon also, another slave, having assembled seventy thousand
slaves, joins him; and they, several times, engage the Roman
forces in those parts.</p>

<p>Scipio Africanus laid siege to Numantia, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 619. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 133,]
and restored to the strictest military discipline the army, which had
been corrupted by licentiousness and luxury: this he effected by
cutting off every kind of pleasurable gratification; driving away the
prostitutes who followed the camp, to the number of two thousand;
keeping the soldiers to hard labour, and compelling every man to
bear on his shoulders provisions for thirty days, besides seven stakes
for their fortifications; to any one who lagged behind on account of
the burden, he used to cry out, When you are able to defend yourself
with your sword, then cease to carry your fortification; he ordered
another who carried with ease a small shield, to bear one unusually
large; and not unfrequently ridiculed them for being more expert
in managing their shields for the defence of their own bodies, than
their swords for the annoyance of those of the enemy. When he
found any man absent from his post, he ordered him to be flogged
with vine twigs, if a Roman; if a foreigner, with rods. He sold all
the beasts of burden, that the soldiers might be forced to carry their
own baggage. He engaged in frequent skirmishes with the enemy,
with good success. The Vacc&aelig;ans, being reduced to extremity, first
put their wives and children to death, and then slew themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2184" id="Page_2184">Pg 2184</a></span>
Antiochus, king of Syria, having sent him some very magnificent
presents, Scipio, contrary to the practice of other commanders who
used to conceal these royal gifts, received them openly, and ordered
the qu&aelig;stor to place the whole to the public account, and promised
out of them, to reward those who should most distinguish themselves
by their valour. When Numantia was closely invested on all
sides, he gave orders that those who came out in search of victuals
should not be killed; saying, that the more numerous the inhabitants
were, the sooner would their provisions be consumed.</p>

<h3><a name="bk58" id="bk58"></a>BOOK LVIII.</h3>

<p>Titus Sempronius Gracchus, the plebeian tribune, having proposed
an Agrarian law, (contrary to the sense of the senate, and the equestrian
order,) to the effect that no person should hold more than five
hundred acres of the public lands, wrought himself up to such a
degree of passion that he deprived his colleague, Marcus Octavius, of
his authority by a law which he made, and appointed himself, together
with his brother Caius, and his father-in-law Appius Claudius, commissioners
for dividing the lands. He also proposed another Agrarian
law, by which the land was still more at his disposal, that the
same commissioners should be authorized to determine which was
public and which private land. When afterwards it appeared that
there was not land sufficient to be divided so as to satisfy the people,
whose hopes he had raised to cupidity by the expectations held out
to them, he declared that he would propose a law, that all those,
who by the law of Sempronius were entitled to such grant, should
be paid in money out of the bequest of king Attalus. But Attalus,
king of Pergamus, son of Eumenes, had made the Romans his
heirs. The senate was roused to indignation at such repeated ill-treatment;
and chiefly Publius Mucius, the consul, who, having
delivered a severe invective against Gracchus in the senate, was
seized by him, dragged before the people, and accused; nevertheless
he continued to inveigh against him from the rostrum. Gracchus,
endeavouring to procure his re-election as tribune, was slain in the
Capitol, by the chief nobles, by the advice of Publius Cornelius
Nasica, after having been beaten first with the fragments of the seats,
and was thrown, without the rites of sepulture, into the river, together
with some others who fell in the tumult. Various engagements, with
various success, against the slaves in Sicily are recorded.</p>

an end to the war with the slaves in Sicily. Aristonicus, the son of
king Eumenes, invades and seizes Asia; which having been bequeathed
to the Roman people by Attalus, ought to be free. The
consul, Publius Licinius Crassus, who was also chief priest, marches
against him out of Italy, (which never was done before,) engages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2185" id="Page_2185">Pg 2185</a></span>
with him in battle, is beaten and slain. Marcus Peperna, the consul,
subdued Aristonicus. Quintus Metellus and Quintus Pomponius,
the first plebeians who were ever both at one time elected censors,
closed the lustrum; the number of citizens amounted to three hundred
and thirteen thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, besides
orphans and widows, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 621. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 131.] Quintus Metellus gives
his opinion, that every man should be compelled to marry, in order
to increase the population of the state. His speech upon the occasion,
is still extant, and so exactly does it apply to the present times,
that Augustus C&aelig;sar read it in the senate upon occasion of his proposing
to release marriage from all restraints on account of the
difference of rank. Caius Atinius Labeo, tribune of the people,
orders the censor, Quintus Metellus, to be thrown from the Tarpeian
rock for striking him out of the list of the senate; but the other
tribunes interfere and protect him. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 622. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 130.] Quintus
Carbo, the plebeian tribune, proposes a law that the people might
have the power of re-electing the same tribune as often as they
please: Publius Africanus argues against the proposition in a speech
of great energy, in which he asserts that Tiberius Gracchus was
justly put to death. Gracchus supports the proposed law; but Scipio
prevails. War was waged between Antiochus, king of Syria, and
Phraates, king of Parthia, nor does the record show that greater
tranquillity existed in Egypt. Ptolemy, surnamed Evergetes, being
detested on account of his cruelty by his subjects, who set his palace
on fire, escaped to Cyprus, and when the people conferred the kingdom
upon his sister Cleopatra, whom he had divorced, after having
first ravished and then married her daughter; he being enraged,
murders the son he had by her at Cyprus, and sent his head and
limbs to the mother, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 623. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 129.] Seditions were excited
by Fulvius Flaccus, Caius Gracchus, and Caius Carbo, appointed
to carry into execution the Agrarian law: these were opposed by
Publius Scipio Africanus, who going home at night in perfect health,
was found dead in his chamber the next morning. His wife, Sempronia,
sister of the Gracchuses, with whom Scipio was at enmity, was
strongly suspected of having given him poison: no inquiry however
was made into the matter. Upon his death the popular seditions
blaze out with great fury. Caius Sempronius, the consul, fought the
Iapid&aelig;, at first unsuccessfully, but soon repairs all his losses by a
signal victory, gained by the valour of Junius Brutus, the conqueror
of Lusitania.</p>

shall be supplied with the article in the market at the rate of half
and a third of an <i>as</i>; also an Agrarian law, the same as his brother&#8217;s:
and a third intended to corrupt the equestrian order, who at that
time were subservient in all their opinions to the senate: namely,
that six hundred of them should be admitted into the senate: these
six hundred equestrians were to be joined to three hundred senators
for at that time there were only three hundred senators; that is, in
other words, that the equestrian order should have double influence
in the senate. His office being continued to him another year, by
Agrarian laws which he passed, he caused that many colonies should
be led out into Italy, and he himself, having been made triumvir,
headed one to the territory of demolished Carthage, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 628.

fought the Allobrogians with success at the town of Vindalium.
The cause of this war was their receiving, and furnishing with all

Fulvius Flaccus, a man of consular rank, a participator of the same
wild project. Quintus Fabius Maximus, the consul, nephew of Paullus,

for refusing to swear to the observance of it. Metellus, notwithstanding
he enjoyed the protection of all the best men in the state,
yet, being unwilling to furnish matter of dispute, retires into voluntary
exile, to Rhodes: there he passed his time entirely in study,
and in receiving the visits of men of eminent character, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 652.
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 100.] Caius Marius, the chief promoter of the sedition, who
had now purchased a fourth consulship, by openly distributing
money among the tribes, pronounced sentence of banishment upon
him after his departure. The same Appuleius Saturninus murders
Caius Memmius, who was a candidate for the consulship, fearing
lest he might have, in him, a strenuous opposer of his evil actions.
By which conduct the senate was aroused, and Caius Marius, when
he could no longer defend Saturninus, being a man of fickle and versatile

disposition, who always suited his plans to circumstances,
joined it. Saturninus, with Glaucias, and other participators of the
same mad conduct, having been overpowered by force of arms, was
killed in what may be considered a war. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 653. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 99.]
Quintus C&aelig;cilius Metellus was recalled from banishment by the
decided favour of the whole state. Marcus Aquilius, the proconsul
put an end to the servile war in Sicily.</p>

refused to implore the favour of the judges appointed to try
him. Marcus Antonius, his advocate, cut open his vest, and
showed the scars of his honourable wounds; upon sight of which
he was clearly acquitted, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 655. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 97.] This fact is related

Publius Rutilius, a man of the strictest integrity, because he exerted
himself, when lieutenant-general under Quintus Mucius, the proconsul,
to protect the people of Asia from the oppression of the
revenue farmers, became odious to the equestrian order, who had
the cognizance of affairs of that nature, and being brought to trial,
was condemned to exile, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 659. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 93.] Caius Sentius, the
pr&aelig;tor, fought unsuccessfully against the Thracians. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 660.

of the equestrian order in the exercise of their judicial functions,
tried, by all its influence, to have those functions transferred to
itself, and Marcus Livius Drusus, the plebeian tribune, promoting
this design, stimulated the people, by the pernicious hope of bribes,
to add their sanction. Moreover a commotion occurred among the
kings of Syria.</p>

in order the more effectually to support the senate in their pretensions,
gained the concurrence of the allies, and the Italian states,
by promising them the freedom of the city. Aided by them, besides
the Agrarian and corn laws, he carried that also relative to
criminal jurisdiction;&mdash;that in capital prosecutions the senate
should have equal authority with the equestrian order. It was
afterwards found that the freedom which he had promised could
not be conferred upon them; which incensed and incited them to
revolt. An account is given of their assembling,&mdash;their combinations
and speeches made at their meetings, by the chief men among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2191" id="Page_2191">Pg 2191</a></span>

<p>The Italian states, the Picentians, Vestinians, Marcians, Pelignians,
Marrucinians, Samnites, and Lucanians, revolted, the war
commencing with the Picentians. Quintus Servilius, the proconsul,
was murdered, in the town of Asculum, with all the Roman citizens
in the place. The whole body of the Roman people assumed the
military dress. Servius Galba, having been taken by the Lucanians,
escaped by the assistance of a woman with whom he lodged.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 662. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 90.] &AElig;sernia and Alba were besieged by the
Italians. Aid was sent to the Romans by the Latins, and other
foreign nations, and the expeditions, and sieges, on both sides, are
recorded.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk73" id="bk73"></a>BOOK LXXIII.</h3>

<p>The consul, Lucius Julius C&aelig;sar, fought against the Samnites
unsuccessfully. The colony of Nola fell into the hands of the Samnites,
together with Lucius Posthumius, the pr&aelig;tor, whom they
killed. Many different states went over to the enemy. After Publius
Rutilius had fought unsuccessfully against the Marcians, and
had been slain in battle, Caius Marius, his lieutenant-general, encountered
them with better success. Servius Sulpicius defeated
the Pelignians, in a pitched battle. Quintus C&aelig;pio, Rutilius&#8217;s
lieutenant-general, made a successful sally against the enemy besieging
him; on account of which success he was made equal in command
to Marius, and becoming adventurous and rash, was surprised
in an ambuscade, and his army being defeated, was slain. Lucius
Julius C&aelig;sar, the consul, fought successfully against the Samnites.
On account of this victory the inhabitants of Rome laid aside
the military habit; the war being carried on with various success,
&AElig;sernia, with Marcellus, fell into the hands of the Samnites.
Caius Marius vanquished the Marcians, Herius Asinius, the pr&aelig;tor
of the Marrucinians, being killed. Caius C&aelig;cilius subdued the
rebellious Salvians in Trausalpine Gaul.</p>

<p>Cneius Pompeius defeated the Picentians, and laid siege to their
town; on account of this victory the inhabitants of Rome resume
their purple robes, and other distinguishing marks of magistracy.
Caius Marius fought an undecided battle with the Marcians.
Freedmen&#8217;s sons were now first received into the army. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 663.
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 89.] Aulus Plotius, the lieutenant, subdued the Umbrians,
and Lucius Porcius, the pr&aelig;tor, the Marcians, both of whom had
revolted. Nicomedes was restored to the kingdom of Bithynia, and
Ariobarzanes to that of Cappadocia. Cneius Pompeius, the consul,
overthrew the Marcians in a pitched battle. The citizens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2192" id="Page_2192">Pg 2192</a></span>
being deeply involved in debt, Aulus Sempronius Asellio, the
pr&aelig;tor, was murdered in the forum, by the usurers, in consequence
of some judgments given by him in favour of debtors. Incursions
were made by the Thracians, and devastations committed against
the Macedonians.</p>

<h3><a name="bk75" id="bk75"></a>BOOK LXXV.</h3>

<p>Aulus Posthumius Albinus, commander of a fleet, upon a suspicion
of treachery, was murdered by the forces under his command.
Lucius Cornelius Sylla, lieutenant-general, defeated the
Samnites, and took two of their camps. The Vestinians surrendered
to Cneius Pompeius. Lucius Porcius, the consul, having
been successful in frequent engagements with the Marcians, was
slain in an attack upon their camp, which circumstance decided the
victory in favour of the enemy. Cosconius and Lucceius overthrew
the Samnites in a battle, slew Marius Egnatius, the most distinguished
of their generals, and received the surrender of many of
their towns. Lucius Sylla subdued the Hirpinians, defeated the
Samnites in many battles, and received the submission of several
states; in consequence of having performed so many distinguished
services, as scarcely any one had ever done under the circumstances,
he repaired to Rome to solicit the consulship.</p>

<p>Aulus Gabinius, the lieutenant, having defeated the Lucanians,
and taken several of their towns, was slain in an attack on their
camp. Sulpicius, a lieutenant-general, committed military execution
on the Marrucinians, and reduced their whole country. Cneius
Pompeius, the proconsul, forced the Vestinians and Pelignians to
submission. Also the Marcians, defeated in several battles, by
Lucius Murena and C&aelig;cilius Pius, sued for peace, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 664.
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 88.] Asculum was taken by Cneius Pompeius, and the Italians
there were put to death by Mamercus &AElig;milius. Silo Pomp&aelig;dius,
the author of the revolt, was killed in an action. Ariobarzanes,
king of Cappadocia, and Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, were driven
out of their kingdoms by Mithridates, king of Pontus. Predatory
incursions were made by the Thracians into Macedon.</p>

<h3><a name="bk77" id="bk77"></a>BOOK LXXVII.</h3>

<p>Publius Sulpicius, the tribune of the people, having, with the aid
of Caius Marius, carried certain laws: &#8220;that those who had been
banished should be recalled; that the newly-created citizens, and the
sons of freed-men, should be distributed among the tribes, and that
Caius Marius should be appointed general against Mithidrates, king
of Pontus,&#8221; and having used violence towards Quintus Pompeius
and Lucius Sylla, the consuls, who had opposed these proceedings;
Quintus, the son of Pompeius, who was married to Sylla&#8217;s daughter,
being murdered, Lucius Sylla came into the town with an army, and
fought against the faction of Sulpicius and Marius, in the city, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2193" id="Page_2193">Pg 2193</a></span>
drove it out. Twelve of the number, among whom are Caius Marius,
the father, and his son, were condemned by the senate. Publius Sulpicius
having concealed himself in a farm-house in the neighbourhood,
being betrayed by one of his slaves, was apprehended and put
to death. The slave, being entitled to the reward promised to the discoverer,
was made free; and was then thrown from the Tarpeian
rock, for having traitorously betrayed his master. Caius Marius,
the son, passed over into Africa. Caius Marius, the father, having
concealed himself in the marshes of Minturna, was seized by the
towns-people: after a Gallic slave who was sent to despatch him,
being terrified at his majestic appearance, had retired, unable to
accomplish the deed, he was publicly placed in a vessel, and sent off
to Africa. Lucius Sylla reformed the state, and afterwards sent forth
colonies. Cneius Pompeius, the proconsul, procured the murder
of Quintus Pompeius, the consul, who was to have succeeded him
in the command of the army. Mithridates, king of Pontus, seized
Bithynia and Cappadocia, after having driven the Roman general,
Aquilius, out of them: and at the head of a great army entered
Phrygia, a province belonging to the Roman people.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk78" id="bk78"></a>BOOK LXXVIII.</h3>

<p>Mithridates possessed himself of Asia; threw into chains Quintus
Oppius, the proconsul, and Aquilius, the general; and ordered all
the Romans in Asia to be massacred on the same day; he attacked
the city of Rhodes, the only one which had retained its fidelity to
the Roman state; and being overcome in several actions at sea, he
retreated, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 665. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 87.] Archelaus, one of the king&#8217;s
governors, invaded Greece and took Athens. Commotions resulted
in several states and islands, some endeavouring to draw over their
people to the side of the Romans, others to that of Mithridates.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk79" id="bk79"></a>BOOK LXXIX.</h3>

<p>Lucius Cornelius Cinna having, by force of arms, procured the
enactment of several injurious laws, was driven out of the city by
his colleague, Cneius Octavius, together with six plebeian tribunes.
Thus deposed from the authority, he procured the command of his
army under Appius Claudius, by bribery, and made war upon the
city, having called to his assistance Caius Marius, and other
exiles, from Africa. In this war, two brothers, (one of Pompeius&#8217;s
army, the other of Cinna&#8217;s,) encountered each other without knowing
it; and when the conqueror despoiling the enemy recognised
his brother, he vented his grief in uncontrolled lamentation, and
having prepared a funeral pile for him, he stabbed himself on it,
and was consumed with him. Although this war might have been
suppressed at first, yet owing to the treachery of Pompeius, who,
by encouraging either party, gave power to Cinna, whilst he only
succoured the patriotic party when their energies were exhausted;
and also to the neglect of the consul; Cinna and Marius, with four
armies, two of which were commanded by Sertorius and Carbo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2194" id="Page_2194">Pg 2194</a></span>
gained strength and laid siege to the city. Marius took Ostia, which
he plundered in the most cruel manner.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk80" id="bk80"></a>BOOK LXXX.</h3>

<p>The freedom of the city of Rome was granted to the Italian states.
The Samnites, the only people who continued in arms, joined
Cinna and Marius, and overthrew Plautius&#8217;s army, killing the
general. Cinna and Marius, with Carbo and Sertorius, seized the
Janiculum; and were repelled by the consul Octavius. Marius
plunders Antium, Aricia, and Lanuvium. The principal men in
the state having now no hope of resisting, on account of the cowardice
and treachery both of the generals and soldiers, who, being
bribed, either refused to fight, or deserted to one party or another,
received Cinna and Marius into the city, who, as if it had been
captured, devastated it by murder and robbery, putting to death
the consul, Cneius Octavius, and all the chiefs of the opposite
party; among others, Marcus Antonius, a man highly distinguished
for his eloquence, with Lucius and Caius C&aelig;sar, whose heads they
stuck up on the rostrum. The younger Crassus having been slain
by a party of horsemen at Fimbria; his father, to escape suffering
insult, killed himself. Cinna and Marius, without even the
formality of an election, declared themselves consuls; and on the
first day of their entering upon office, Marius ordered Sextus
Licinius, a senator, to be cast from the Tarpeian rock, and after
having committed very many atrocious acts, died on the ides of
January. If we compare his vices with his virtues, it will be
difficult to pronounce whether he was greater in war, or more
wicked in peace. Having preserved his country by his valour, he
ruined it afterwards by every species of artifice and fraud; and
finally destroyed it by open force.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk81" id="bk81"></a>BOOK LXXXI.</h3>

<p>Lucius Sylla besieged Athens, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 666. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 86,] held by
Archelaus, under Mithridates, and took it, after an obstinate resistance.
The city and such of the inhabitants as remained alive,
were restored to liberty. Magnesia, the only city in Asia which
continued faithful, was defended against Mithridates with great
valour. The Thracians invaded Macedon.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk82" id="bk82"></a>BOOK LXXXII.</h3>

<p>Sylla defeated Mithridates in Thessaly, killing one hundred
thousand men, and taking their camp. The war being renewed,
he entirely routed and destroyed the king&#8217;s army. Archelaus,
with the royal fleet, surrendered to Sylla. Lucius Valerius Flaccus,
Cinna&#8217;s colleague in the consulship, who was appointed to succeed
Sylla in the command of his army, became so odious to his men, on
account of his avarice, that he was slain by Caius Fimbria, his
lieutenant-general, a man of consummate audacity, who assumed
the command. Several cities in Asia were taken by Mithridates,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2195" id="Page_2195">Pg 2195</a></span>
who treated them with extreme cruelty. Macedon was invaded
by the Thracians.</p>

<h3><a name="bk83" id="bk83"></a>BOOK LXXXIII.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 667. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 85.] Caius Fimbria having defeated several of
Mithridates&#8217; generals in Asia, took the city of Pergamus, and was
very near making the king captive. He took and destroyed the
city of Ilion, which adhered to Sylla, and recovered a great part of
Asia. Sylla overcame the Thracians in several battles. Lucius
Cinna and Cneius Papirius Carbo, having declared themselves consuls,
made preparations for war against Sylla; Lucius Valerius
Flaccus, the chief of the senate, having made a speech among that
body, by their assistance, with that of all who desired tranquillity,
effected that ambassadors should be sent to Sylla, concerning a
treaty of peace. Cinna, attempting to force his men to embark and
go against Sylla, was slain by them. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 668. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 84.] Carbo
alone held the consulship. Sylla made peace in Asia with Mithridates,
upon conditions that the king should evacuate Asia, Bithynia,
and Cappadocia. Fimbria, deserted by his army, which went over to
Sylla, put himself to death, by calling on his slave to cut off his head.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk84" id="bk84"></a>BOOK LXXXIV.</h3>

<p>Sylla replied to deputies sent by the senate, that he would yield
to the authority of the senate, upon condition that those who, being
banished by Cinna, had fled to him, should be restored; which
proposition appeared reasonable to the senate, but was opposed and
rejected by Carbo and his faction, who conceived that they would
derive more advantage from a continuance of the war. Carbo,
requiring hostages from all the towns and colonies of Italy, to bind
them more firmly in union against Sylla, was overruled by the
senate. The right of voting was given to the new citizens by a
decree of the senate. Quintus Metellus Pius, who had taken part
with the chief men of the state, being prepared for war in Africa,
was crushed by Caius Fabius, the pr&aelig;tor, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 660. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 83.]
Carbo&#8217;s faction and the Marian party procured a decree of the
senate, that the armies should every where be disbanded. The sons
of freed-men were distributed among the thirty-five tribes. Preparations
were made for war against Sylla.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk85" id="bk85"></a>BOOK LXXXV.</h3>

<p>Sylla entered Italy at the head of an army, and defeated in a
battle Norbanus, the consul, by whom his ambassadors, sent to negotiate
a peace, had been maltreated. Having ineffectually tried
every means with Lucius Scipio, the other consul, to bring about a
peace, he prepared to attack his camp, when the consul&#8217;s whole
army deserted to Sylla, having been seduced by some soldiers sent
out by him. Scipio was set free, when he could have been killed.
Cneius Pompeius, the son of Pompeius, who took Asculum, raised
an army of volunteers, and went over to Sylla with three legions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2196" id="Page_2196">Pg 2196</a></span>
also the whole body of the nobility quit the city and joined his
camp. Sundry actions in different parts of Italy are recorded in
the book.</p>

<p>While Caius Marius, son of Caius Marius, was made consul [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span>
670. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 82] by force, before he was twenty years old, Caius Fabius
was burned alive in his tent, in Africa, for his avarice and extortion.
Lucius Philippus, Sylla&#8217;s lieutenant-general, having overthrown
and killed the pr&aelig;tor, Quintus Antonius, took Sardinia. Sylla
made a league with the states of Italy, lest he should be suspected
of intending to deprive them of their constitution and the right of
suffrage, which had been lately conceded to them. So confident was
he of the victory, that he published an order that all persons engaged
in lawsuits, bound by sureties, should make their appearance at
Rome, although the city was yet in the possession of the opposite
party. Lucius Damasippus, the pr&aelig;tor, having called together the
senate, at the desire of Marius, murdered such of the nobility as
remained in the city; among them Quintus Mucius Sc&aelig;vola, the
high priest, who, endeavouring to make his escape, was killed in the
vestibule of the temple of Vesta. Besides, it includes an account of
the war in Asia against Mithridates, renewed by Lucius Mur&aelig;na.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk87" id="bk87"></a>BOOK LXXXVII.</h3>

<p>Sylla, having conquered and destroyed Caius Marius&#8217;s army, at
Sacriportus, laid siege to Pr&aelig;neste, where Marius had taken refuge.
He recovered Rome out of the hands of his enemies. Marius attempting
to break forth from Pr&aelig;neste, was repelled. This book moreover
contains an account of the successes of the different commanders
under him, every where.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk88" id="bk88"></a>BOOK LXXXVIII.</h3>

<p>Sylla, having routed and cut off the army of Carbo at Clusium,
Faventia, and Fidentia, drove him out of Italy; he completely subdued
the Samnites near the city of Rome, before the Colline gate:
they were the only one of all the Italian states that had not before
laid down their arms. Having restored the affairs of the commonwealth,
he stained his glorious victory with the most atrocious cruelties
ever committed; he murdered eight thousand men in the Villa
Publica, who had submitted and laid down their arms, and published
a list of persons proscribed: he filled with blood the city of Rome,
and all Italy. He ordered all the Pr&aelig;nestines, without exception,
although they had laid down their arms, to be murdered; he
killed Marius, a senator, by breaking his legs and arms, cutting off
his ears, and scooping out his eyes. Caius Marius, being besieged at
Pr&aelig;neste by Lucretius Asella, one of the partisans of Sylla, having
endeavoured to escape through a mine, was intercepted by an army,
and committed suicide; this took place in the centre of the mine,
when he found it impossible to escape with Pontius Telesinus, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2197" id="Page_2197">Pg 2197</a></span>
companion of his flight, for each having drawn his sword, rushed
madly on: when he had slain Telesinus, he himself, being wounded,
begged of a slave that he would despatch him.</p>

<h3><a name="bk89" id="bk89"></a>BOOK LXXXIX.</h3>

<p>Marcus Brutus being sent in a fishing-boat to Lilyb&aelig;um, by
Cneius Papirius Carbo, who had sailed to Cossura, to discover if
Pompeius were there, and being surrounded by the ships, which
Pompey had sent, turned the point of his sword against himself,
and threw himself on it with all the weight of his body, at one of
the ship&#8217;s benches. Cneius Pompeius, being sent by the senate to
Sicily, with full powers, having taken Carbo prisoner, put him to
death; he dies weeping with womanly weakness. Sylla, having
been created dictator, marched through the city with twenty-four
lictors, which no one had ever done before. He established new
regulations in the state; abridged the authority of the plebeian
tribunes; took from them the power of proposing laws; increased
the college of priests and augurs to fifteen; filled up the senate from
the equestrian order; took from the descendants of the proscribed
persons all power of reclaiming the property of their ancestors, and
sold such of their effects as had not been already confiscated, to the
amount of one hundred and fifty millions of sesterces. He ordered
Lucretius Ofella to be put to death in the forum, for having declared
himself a candidate for the consulship, without having previously
obtained his permission; and when the people of Rome were offended,
he called a meeting, and told them that Ofella was slain by his
orders, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 671. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 81.] Cneius Pompeius vanquished and killed,
in Africa, Cneius Domitius, one of the proscribed persons, and
Hiarbas, king of Numidia, who were making preparations for war.
He triumphed over Africa, although not more than twenty-four
years of age, and only of equestrian rank, which never happened
to any man before. Caius Norbanus, of consular rank, being proscribed,
when he was taken at Rhodes, committed suicide. Mutilus,
one of the proscribed, coming privately and in disguise to the back
door of his wife Bastia&#8217;s house, was refused admission, and she
told him that he was a proscribed man, whereupon he stabbed himself,
and sprinkled the door of his wife&#8217;s house with his blood. Sylla
took Nolla, a city of the Samnites, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 672. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 80,] and led forth
forty-seven legions into the conquered lands, and divided them
among them. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 673. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 79.] He besieged and took the town
of Volaterra, which was as yet at war with him. Mitylene, the only
town in Asia which continued to adhere to Mithridates, was likewise
stormed and demolished.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk90" id="bk90"></a>BOOK XC.</h3>

<p>Sylla died, and the honour was paid him by the senate of being
buried in the Campus Martius. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 674. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 78.] Marcus &AElig;milius
Lepidus, attempting to rescind the acts of Sylla, raised a war,

raised a formidable war in Farther Spain. Lucius Manilius,

Sertorius and Peperna, with both their armies; Pompeius, desirous
of having a share in this victory, engaged in the action, but without
success. Sertorius, besieged in Clunia, made frequent sallies, to the
great loss of the besiegers, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 677. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 75.] This book contains,
moreover, an account of the successful expedition of Curio, the proconsul,

who reduced them into the form of a province, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 678. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 74.]
Mithridates, having established a league with Sertorius, declared
war against Rome; he made vast preparations, both by land and sea,
and seized Bithynia: Marcus Aurelius Cotta was overcome in an
action by the king, at Chalcedon. This book contains the history
of the actions of Pompey and Metellus against Sertorius, who was
equal to them in all the tactics of war and military service, and
having driven them from the blockade of the town of Calagurris,
he compelled them to retire to different countries&mdash;Metellus to
Farther Spain, and Pompey to Gaul.</p>

repressed a mutiny among his soldiers which originated from an
eager desire of fighting. Deiotarus, tetrarch of Gallogr&aelig;cia, killed
certain officers of Mithridates who were stirring up war in Phrygia.

<p>Caius Curio, the proconsul, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 679. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 73,] subdued the
Dardanians, in Thrace. Seventy-four gladiators, belonging to Lentulus,
make their escape from Capua, and having collected a great
number of slaves and hired servants, and having put themselves
under the command of Crixus and Spartacus, they defeated, in a
battle, Claudius Pulcher, a lieutenant-general, and Publius Varenus,
the pr&aelig;tor. Lucius Lucullus, the proconsul, destroyed the
army of Mithridates, by the sword and famine, at Cyzicus; and
obliged that king, when driven from Bithynia, and broken down
by various misfortunes arising from war and shipwrecks, to take
refuge in Pontus.</p>

commander of the fugitive gladiators, with twenty thousand men.
Cneius Lentulus, the consul, engaged Spartacus unsuccessfully,
who also defeated Lucius Gellius, the consul, and Quintus Arrius,
the pr&aelig;tor. Sertorius was slain at a feast, in the eighth year of his
command, by Manius Antonius, Marcus Peperna, and other conspirators:
he was a great general, and although opposed to two
eminent commanders, Pompeius and Metellus, was often equal, and
sometimes even superior, to both of them; at last, being deserted and
betrayed, the command of his force devolved upon Peperna, whom
Pompeius took prisoner and slew, and recovered Spain, towards the
close of the tenth year of that war. Caius Crassus, the proconsul,
and Cneius Manlius, the pr&aelig;tor, fought Spartacus unsuccessfully;
the charge of that war was committed to the pr&aelig;tor, Marcus
Crassus.</p>

first with that part of the fugitives which was composed of
Gauls and Germans, and slew thirty-five thousand of them, with
their general, Granicus; afterwards he fought with Spartacus,
killing him and forty thousand men. Marcus Antonius, the pr&aelig;tor,
ended, by his death, the war against the Cretans, which
had been unsuccessfully undertaken. Marcus Lucullus, the proconsul,
subdued the Thracians. Lucius Lucullus fought successfully
against Mithridates in Pontus, more than sixty thousand of
the enemy being slain, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 682. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 70.] Marcus Crassus and
Cneius Pompey, being made consuls, restored the tribunitian
power; the latter, being of the equestrian order, had not filled the
office of qu&aelig;stor. The right of trial was transferred to the Roman
knights, by the pr&aelig;tor, Lucius Aurelius Cotta. The affairs of
Mithridates being reduced to a state of desperation, he flew for
refuge to Tigranes, king of Armenia.</p>

<p>A treaty of friendship was made by Machares, son of Mithridates,
king of Bosphorus, with Lucius Lucullus. Cneius Lentulus
and Caius Gellius, the censors, exercised their office with extreme
rigour; expelling sixty-four senators. The lustrum was closed,
and the number of citizens amounted to four hundred and fifty thousand.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 683. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 69.] Lucius Metellus, the pr&aelig;tor, was successful
against the pirates in Sicily. The temple of Jupiter in the

by Quintus Catulus. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 684. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 68.] Lucius Lucullus defeated
Mithridates and Tigranes, with their vast armies, in Armenia,

to the charge of the proconsul, Quintus Metellus, he laid
siege to the city of Cydonia. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 685. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 67.] Lucius Triarius,
a lieutenant-general of Lucullus, was defeated in a battle against
Mithridates. Lucullus was prevented, by a sedition in his army,
from pursuing Mithridates and Tigranes, and completing his
victory; the Valerian legions refused to follow Lucullus, alleging
that they had served out their time.</p>

<p>The proconsul, Quintus Metellus, took Gnossus, Lyctus, Cydonia,
and many other cities. Lucius Roscius, the plebeian tribune,
carried a law, that the fourteen lower seats in the theatre shall be
allotted to the Roman knights. Cneius Pompeius, being ordered
by a law, which had the sanction of the people, to proceed against
the pirates, who had interrupted the commerce of corn, in forty
days drove them wholly from the sea; and having finished the war
against them in Cilicia, and reduced them to submission, assigned
them lands and towns. This book contains, moreover, the
history of the successes of Metellus against the Cretans, the letters
between Metellus and Pompeius. Metellus complained that Pompeius
had robbed him of the glory of his actions, in sending a
deputy of his own to receive the submission of the Cretans. Pompeius
alleged that he had a right to do so.</p>

<p>Caius Manilius, the tribune of the people, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 686. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 66,] to
the great dissatisfaction of the nobility, proposed that the Mithridatic
war should be committed to the conduct of Pompeius. He
made an admirable speech on the occasion. Quintus Metellus,
having subdued Crete, imposed laws upon that hitherto free island.
Cneius Pompeius, on setting out for the war against Mithridates, renewed
the treaty of friendship with Phraates, king of Parthia; he
overcame Mithridates in an engagement between their cavalry.
This book contains also the history of the war between Phraates,
king of Parthia, and Tigranes, king of Armenia; afterwards, between
the father and son Tigranes.</p>

<p>Cneius Pompeius vanquished Mithridates, in a battle fought in
the night, and compelled him to fly to Bosphorus; reduced Tigranes
to submission, taking from him Syria, Ph&#339;nicia, and
Cilicia; and restored to him his own kingdom of Armenia. The
conspiracy planned by those, who had been found guilty of bribery
in seeking the consulship, to murder the consuls, was suppressed.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 687. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 65.] Pompeius pursued Mithridates into remote,
and even unknown regions; he conquered in battle the Iberians
and Albanians, who had refused him a passage through their territories.

through Colchis and the country of the Heinochi, and of his
actions at Bosphorus.</p>

Pharnaces, son of Mithridates, made war upon his father. Mithridates,
besieged in his palace, took poison, and, when this did not
produce the desired effect, he caused himself to be slain by a Gaul,
named Bituitus. Pompeius conquered the Jews, and took their
hitherto unviolated temple at Jerusalem. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 688. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 64.] Catiline,
having twice failed in his suit for the consulship, forms a conspiracy,
with Lentulus, Cethegus, and others, to destroy the consuls
and the senate, to burn the city, and seize the commonwealth: he
raised an army in Etruria; [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 689. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 63;] the conspiracy was
discovered, and frustrated by the exertions of Marcus Tullius
Cicero, the consul. Catiline was driven out of Rome; the other

by the proconsul, Caius Antonius. Publius Clodius being accused
of having, disguised in woman&#8217;s apparel, entered a chapel, which it
was not lawful for a man to enter, and of having defiled the wife
of the high priest, was acquitted. Caius Pontinius, the pr&aelig;tor,
subdued at Solon the Allobrogians, who had rebelled. Publius
Clodius joined the party of the people. Caius C&aelig;sar subdued the
Lusitanians: [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 691. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 51:] being a candidate for the consulship,
and determined to seize the power of the commonwealth

of Gaul, subdued the Helvetians, a wandering tribe, who, seeking
a place of settlement, attempted to pass through Narbo, a part of
his province. This book contains a description of the situation of
Gaul. Pompeius triumphed over the children of Mithridates,
Tigranes, and also the son of the latter; and the surname of the
Great was conferred upon him by a full assembly of the people.</p>

<h3><a name="bk104" id="bk104"></a>BOOK CIV.</h3>

<p>This book commences with a description of the situation of
Germany, and the manners and customs of the natives. Caius
C&aelig;sar, at the request of the &AElig;duans and Sequanians, whose country
had been seized upon, leads his army against the Germans,
who had invaded Gaul, under the command of Ariovistus, roused
by an address the courage of his soldiers, who were alarmed at the
unusual appearance of these new enemies, and expelled from Gaul
the Germans, defeated in a battle, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 695. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 57.] Marcus
Tullius Cicero, to the great joy of the senate, and of all Italy, was
recalled from banishment chiefly by the persuasion of Pompeius,
aided by Titus Annius Milo, the plebeian tribune, who also argued
in his favour. The charge of providing corn for the city was committed
to Cneius Pompeius for five years. C&aelig;sar brought to subjection
the Ambians, Suessians, Veromanduans, and Atrebatians, a
people of the Belgians, whose numbers were immense, after having
subdued them in battle. He afterwards, at great risk, engaged the
Nervians, a people belonging to one of the above states, and destroyed
that race; this war they continued with such obstinacy,
that their army was reduced from sixty thousand men to three hundred,
and, of four hundred senators, only three remained alive. A
law being made to reduce Cyprus to the form of a province, and to
confiscate the royal treasure; the management of that business was
committed to Marcus Cato. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 696. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 56.] Ptolemy, being
ill-treated by his subjects, and dethroned, came to Rome. Caius

Marcus Cato, a candidate for the pr&aelig;torship, lost the election,
Vatinius carrying it against him. The same Cato was committed
to prison by the tribune Trebonius, for resisting the law allotting
the provinces, for five years, in the following manner: to C&aelig;sar,
Gaul and Germany; to Pompeius, Spain; and to Crassus, Syria,
and the Parthian war. Aulus Gabinius, the proconsul, restored
Ptolemy to his kingdom of Egypt, and dethroned Archelaus, whom
the people had elected king. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 698. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 54.] C&aelig;sar, having
vanquished the Germans who had invaded Gaul, passed the Rhine,
and subdued the nearest part of it: and then crossed over the sea
into Britain, with adverse fortune, at first owing to opposing tempests,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2203" id="Page_2203">Pg 2203</a></span>

Martius. Certain tribes of the Gauls revolted under the command
of Ambiorix; they insnare and cut off Cotta and Titurius,
lieutenants-general under C&aelig;sar, with the armies under their command:
having attacked the camps of the other legions, who with
difficulty defended them, and among the rest the camp of Quintus
Cicero, who commanded in the country of the Nervii, they were
defeated by C&aelig;sar in battle. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 699. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 53.] Marcus Crassus
crossed the Euphrates, to make war against the Parthians, and was
overthrown in a battle, in which his son was killed, after he had collected
the remains of his army upon a rising ground: having been
invited to a conference by the enemy, whose leader was Surenas,
under the pretence of a treaty of peace, he was insnared, and fell
fighting bravely, to prevent his suffering indignity from the enemy
while alive.</p>

<p>Caius C&aelig;sar, having subdued the Trevirian Gauls, passed over a
second time into Germany; finding no enemy there, he returned to
Gaul, and reduced to obedience the Eburones, and other cities,
which had revolted. Titus Annius Milo, a candidate for the consulship,
killed Publius Clodius on the Appian road, near Bovilla:
the people burned the body of the latter in the curia, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 700. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
52.] The candidates for the consulship, Hyps&aelig;us, Scipio, and Milo,
carried on their contention with so much rancour, as to come to
open violence, which excited a seditious tumult. To repress these
enormities, Cneius Pompeius was a third time elected consul, in his
absence, and without a colleague,&mdash;a circumstance which never
occurred before. Milo was tried for the murder of Clodius, and
condemned to banishment. A law was made, notwithstanding the
strenuous opposition of Marcus Cato, to empower C&aelig;sar to stand
for the consulship, though absent. This book contains also the
history of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s operations against the Gauls, who had almost all
revolted, and put themselves under the command of Vercingetorix:
he took many towns; amongst others, Avaricum, Biturium, and
Gergovia.</p>

qu&aelig;stor, defeated the Parthians who had passed over into Syria.
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 701. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 51.] Marcus Cato failed in his suit for the consulship;
the successful candidates being Servius Sulpicius and
Marcus Marcellus. Caius C&aelig;sar subdued the Bellovacians, and
other Gallic tribes. This book contains, moreover, the record of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2204" id="Page_2204">Pg 2204</a></span>
disputes between the consuls, concerning the sending out of a person
to succeed C&aelig;sar; Marcellus contending that C&aelig;sar should come
home to sue for the consulship, being, by a law made expressly for
that purpose, enabled to hold his province until that period; and
also the exploits of Marcus Bibulus in Syria.</p>

to C&aelig;sar, who refused to disband his army, unless Pompeius
should also do the same. And it contains an account of the actions
of Caius Curio, the plebeian tribune, first against C&aelig;sar, afterwards
in his favour. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 703. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 49.] A decree of the senate
being passed, that a successor to C&aelig;sar should be appointed, Marcus
Antonius and Quintus Cassius being driven out of the city, for
protesting against that measure, orders were sent by the senate to
the consuls, and to Cneius Pompeius, to take care that the commonwealth
should sustain no injury. C&aelig;sar, determined to make
war upon his enemies, arrived in Italy with his army, took Corfinium,
and in it Lucius Domitius and Lucius Lentulus, whom he
discharged; and drove Cneius Pompeius and his adherents out
of Italy.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar besieged Masilia, the gates of which had been shut against
him; leaving his lieutenants-general, Caius Trebonius and Decimus
Brutus, to carry on the siege, he set out for Spain, where Lucius
Afranius and Caius Petreius, Pompeius&#8217;s lieutenants-general, with
seven legions, surrendered to him at Ilerda: he dismissed them all
in safety. He also reduced to submission Varro, another lieutenant-general
of Pompeius, with the army under his command. He
granted the privileges of Roman citizens to the Gaditanians. The
Massilians were defeated in two engagements at sea; after having
sustained a long siege, they yielded to C&aelig;sar. Caius Antonius, a
lieutenant-general of C&aelig;sar, having made an unsuccessful attack
upon Pompeius&#8217;s forces in Illyria, was taken prisoner. In the
course of this war, the inhabitants of Opitergium, a district beyond
the Po, in alliance with C&aelig;sar, seeing their bridge blocked up by
the enemy&#8217;s ships, rather than fall into their hands, killed one
another. Caius Curio, one of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s lieutenants-general in Africa,
after a successful engagement with Varus, a general of the Pompeian
party, was cut off, together with his army, by Juba, king of Mauritania.

excited a sedition in the city, by holding out hopes to the people
that their debts should be annulled, his office being taken from
him, was driven from the city: he joined Milo, who, being in exile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2205" id="Page_2205">Pg 2205</a></span>
was raising an army of fugitives: they were both slain while
preparing for war. Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, was dethroned
by her brother Ptolemy. The Cordubians in Spain, harassed by
the extortion and oppression of the pr&aelig;tor, Quintus Cassius, desert
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s party, together with two legions. Cneius Pompeius being
besieged by C&aelig;sar at Dyrracchium, beats him out of his lines; the
siege being raised, the seat of war was removed to Thessaly;
C&aelig;sar conquered Pompeius in a battle at Pharsalia. Cicero remained
in the camp, as he was a man better calculated for any
thing than war. C&aelig;sar granted a free pardon to all who submitted
themselves to his power.</p>

<h3><a name="bk112" id="bk112"></a>BOOK CXII.</h3>

<p>The consternation and flight of the vanquished parties in various
quarters of the world are recorded. Cneius Pompeius, when he
had gone to Egypt, before he could land, was slain in his boat by
Achilles, who had been sent for that purpose, according to the
command of Ptolemy, the young king, who was instigated by
Pothinus and Theodotus, his tutor, who had great influence over
the king. Cornelia, his wife, and Sextus, his son, fled to Cyprus.
C&aelig;sar followed him three days after; and when Theodotus presented
to him the head and ring of Pompeius, he was grievously
offended, and wept over them. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 705. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 47.] C&aelig;sar
entered Alexandria in safety, though it was in a state of tumult.
C&aelig;sar being created dictator, restored Cleopatra to her throne; and
defeated with great slaughter Ptolemy, who had made war upon
him by the advice of those who had caused him to put Pompeius to
death. Ptolemy, in his flight, sunk with his vessel in the Nile.
This book contains also an account of the fatiguing march of Marcus
Cato, with his legions, through the deserts of Africa; and of the
unsuccessful war of Cneius Domitius against Pharnaces.</p>

was deliberated, in council, whether the city of Utica should not be
demolished, on account of its attachment to C&aelig;sar, Cato opposed
that measure, which was strongly recommended by Juba: Cato&#8217;s
opinion prevailing, he was appointed governor of the city. Cneius
Pompeius, the son of Pompeius the Great, having collected some
forces in Spain, which neither Afranius nor Petreius would take
the command of, renews the war against C&aelig;sar. Pharnaces, king
of Pontus, son of Mithridates, after supporting the war but a very
short time, was subdued. When seditions were excited in Rome by
Publius Dolabella, a plebeian tribune, who moved for a law to
abolish the debts of the people, and on that account a tumult
arose among the people, Marcus Antonius, master of the horse,
brought troops into the town, and killed eight hundred of the
people. C&aelig;sar discharged the veteran soldiers, who were grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2206" id="Page_2206">Pg 2206</a></span>
mutinous, crossed over into Africa, and engaged the forces of king
Juba in a very hazardous combat.</p>

<p>C&aelig;cilius Bassus, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 706. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 46,] a Roman knight of the
Pompeian party, stirred up war in Syria; the legion left there
under the command of Sextus C&aelig;sar, having slain their commander,
and revolted to Bassus. C&aelig;sar defeated Scipio the
pr&aelig;tor, Afranius, and Juba, at Thapsus, their camps having been
stormed. Having heard of this circumstance, Cato stabbed himself
at Utica, and by the intervention of his son he might have been
saved, but in the middle of the restoratives, having torn open the
wound, he expired, in his forty-ninth year. Petreius put Juba and
himself to death. Publius Scipio, being surrounded in his ship, to
an honourable death added also a remarkable speech, for to the
enemies who inquired about the general, he said, &#8220;The general is
well.&#8221; Faustus and Afranius were slain. Cato&#8217;s son was pardoned.
Brutus, C&aelig;sar&#8217;s lieutenant-general, defeated the rebellious Bellovacians
in battle.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar triumphed four times; over Gaul, Egypt, Pontus, and
Africa. He gave a feast, and exhibited shows of every description.
To Marcus Marcellus, a man of consular rank, he granted leave to
return at the request of the senate; which favour Marcellus did
not live to enjoy, having been murdered at Athens by Cneius
Magius Cilo, his own dependant. C&aelig;sar held a census, when the
number of citizens amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand,
[<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 707. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 45,] and went to Spain against Cneius Pompey;
where, after many attacks on both sides, many cities having been
stormed, he at length gained a signal victory, after a most desperate
engagement, at Munda. Sextus Pompeius effected his escape.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk116" id="bk116"></a>BOOK CXVI.</h3>

<p>C&aelig;sar triumphed a fifth time over Spain. Very many and high
honours were decreed him by the senate; among others, that he
should be styled Father of his country, and Sacred, and also that
he should be perpetual dictator, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 708. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 44.] It afforded
cause of odium against him, that he rose not to the senate when
conferring these honours on him, as he was sitting before the shrine
of Venus Genetrix; and that he laid aside on a chair the diadem,
placed on his head, by his colleague in the consulship, Marcus
Antonius, who was running among the Lupercalians, and that the
magistracies were taken away from Epidius Marullus and Cassetius
Flavus, the tribunes of the people, who excited envy against him
for aiming at the imperial dignity. For these reasons, a conspiracy
was formed against him; the chiefs of which were, Marcus
Brutus and Caius Cassius, with two of his own partisans,
Decimus Brutus and Caius Trebonius. He was slain in Pompey&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2207" id="Page_2207">Pg 2207</a></span>
senate-house with three-and-twenty wounds; and the Capitol was
seized on by his murderers. An act of amnesty having been
passed by the senate in relation to his murder, and the children of
Antony and Lepidus having been taken as hostages, the conspirators
came down from the Capitol. Octavius, C&aelig;sar&#8217;s nephew,
was by his will made heir of half his possessions. C&aelig;sar&#8217;s body
was burnt by the people, in the Campus Martius, opposite the
rostrum. The office of dictator was abolished for ever. Caius
Amatius, one of the lowest of the people, giving himself out for the
son of Caius Marius, having excited some seditious movements
among the credulous vulgar, was slain.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk117" id="bk117"></a>BOOK CXVII.</h3>

<p>Caius Octavius came to Rome from Epirus, whither C&aelig;sar had
sent him to conduct the war in Macedonia; and, having received
favourable omens, assumed the name of C&aelig;sar. In the confusion
and bustle of affairs, Lepidus procured the office of chief priest.
But when Marcus Antonius, the consul, governed with violence,
and forcibly caused a law to be passed respecting the change of
provinces; and had also given very injurious treatment to C&aelig;sar,
when he requested that he would assist him in punishing the murderers
of his uncle; C&aelig;sar, to strengthen himself and the commonwealth
against him, called out the veteran soldiers, who had been
settled in the colonies. The fourth and Martian legions also
deserted from Antony to C&aelig;sar. Afterwards also very many
revolted to Caasar, on account of the cruelty of Antony, who
slaughtered every where in their own camps even those whom he
suspected. Decimus Brutus, in order to stop Antonius on his way
into Cisalpine Gaul, seized Mutina with his army. This book contains
also the history of the attempts of both parties to possess
themselves of the provinces, and of the preparations for war.</p>

<p>Marcus Brutus, in Greece, under the pretext of supporting the
commonwealth, and the war against Antonius, managed to get the
command of Vatinius&#8217; army and province. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 709. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 43.]
To C&aelig;sar, who had first undertaken to defend the commonwealth
by arms, was given the authority of propr&aelig;tor, with consular ornaments
by the senate, and it was added that he should be enrolled
a senator. Marcus Antonius besieged Brutus at Mutina; and the
ambassadors sent to him by the senate, with a treaty of peace, met
with little success in effecting it. The people of Rome assumed
the military habit. Marcus Brutus reduced under his power Caius
Antonius, the pr&aelig;tor, together with the army which he commanded
in Epirus.</p>

<p>By the treachery of Publius Dolabella, Caius Trebonius was slain
in Asia: for which crime the senate voted Dolabella to be a public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2208" id="Page_2208">Pg 2208</a></span>
enemy. When Pansa, one of the consuls, had fought unsuccessfully
against Antony, Aulus Hirtius, the other consul, coming up
with his army, equalized the fortune of either party, the forces of
Antony being routed. Antonius, afterwards being conquered by
Hirtius and C&aelig;sar, fled into Gaul, and joined to himself Marcus
Lepidus, together with the legions which were under him, and was
declared a public enemy by the senate, together with all his associates.
Aulus Hirtius, who, after his victory, was slain in the
enemy&#8217;s camp, and Lucius Pansa, who died of a wound received in
an unsuccessful battle, were buried in the Campus Martius. To
C&aelig;sar, the only surviving general of the three, the senate showed
but little gratitude; for a triumph was voted to Decimus Brutus, who
was relieved from the siege of Mutina by C&aelig;sar. They did not
mention with sufficient gratitude C&aelig;sar and his soldiers, wherefore
Caius C&aelig;sar, having, by the intervention of Marcus Lepidus, renewed
his friendly relation with Marcus Antonius, came with his
army to Rome, and those who had been unjust to him, being struck
with dread at his approach, he was elected consul in his nineteenth
year.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="bk120" id="bk120"></a>BOOK CXX.</h3>

<p>C&aelig;sar, the consul, introduced a law to hold an inquiry into the
case of those by whose instigation his father had been murdered, and
Marcus Brutus, Caius Cassius, and Decimus Brutus having been
tried by this law, were condemned, though absent. When Asinius
Pollio and Munatius Plancus, having also joined their forces to
those of Antonius, had increased his strength, and when Decimus
Brutus, to whom the senate had given orders to pursue Antony,
being deserted by the legions under his command, had fled, he was
killed by Capenus Sequanus, by order of Antonius, into whose hands
he had fallen. Caius C&aelig;sar became reconciled to Antonius and
Lepidus, so that he and Lepidus and Antony formed a triumvirate
for the administration of the republic for five years, and that they
should proscribe each his particular enemies, in which proscription
were included very many of the equestrian order, and one hundred
and thirty senators; among whom were Lucius Paulus, the brother
of Lepidus, Lucius C&aelig;sar, Antony&#8217;s uncle, and Marcus Tullius
Cicero, whose head and right hand were placed on the rostrum,
when he was murdered in his sixty-third year by Popilius, a legionary
soldier. This book also contains an account of the transactions
of Brutus in Greece.</p>

<p>Caius Cassius, having received orders from the senate to pursue
Dolabella, who had been pronounced a public enemy, acting under
the sanction of the state, reduced Syria under his authority by means
of the three armies which were in that province, and besieging Dolabella,
in Laodicea, put him to death. Caius Antonius, having been
taken, was also slain by order of Marcus Brutus.</p>

<p>Marcus Brutus fought unsuccessfully with the Thracians. Afterwards
all the provinces beyond sea, together with the armies in
them, having been brought into obedience to him and Cassius,
they met at Smyrna, to hold a council relative to the war which
they were about to engage in. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 710. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 42.] They agreed

number of the proscribed Romans, and other fugitives, in Epirus,
wandering about for a long time, subsisting chiefly by piracy; at
length he seized first on Messana in Sicily, and afterwards on the
whole province; and having killed Aulus Pompeius Bithynicus, the
pr&aelig;tor, he defeated Quintus Salvidienus, a general of Cæsar&#8217;s, in a
sea-fight. C&aelig;sar and Antonius, with their armies, passed over into
Greece, to make war against Brutus and Cassius. Quintus Cornificius
conquered, in a battle in Africa, Titus Sestius, the leader of
Cassius&#8217; party.</p>

<p>Caius C&aelig;sar and Antony fought an undecisive battle with
Brutus and Cassius at Philippi; in which the right wing of each
army was victorious; and on both sides the camps were taken:
the death of Cassius turned the scale of fortune; for, being at the
head of that wing which was beaten, he supposed his whole army
routed, and killed himself. Afterwards, in another battle, Brutus,
being overcome, put an end to his life, in his fortieth year, after
entreating Strabo, the companion of his flight, to drive a sword
through him. <i>Many others slew themselves</i>, among whom was Quintus
Hortensius.</p>

the provinces beyond the sea, returned to Italy, and made a distribution
of lands among the veterans. He represses, with great
risk, a mutiny among his soldiers, who, being bribed by Fulvia, the
wife of Marcus Antonius, conspired against their general. Lucius
Antonius, the consul, influenced by Fulvia, made war upon C&aelig;sar,
having taken to his assistance those whose lands C&aelig;sar had distributed
among his veteran soldiers: and having overthrown Lepidus,
who, with an army, had charge of the defence of the city, he
entered it in a hostile manner.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar, now twenty-three years of age, [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 712. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 40,]
besieged Antonius in Perusia, and forced him, after several ineffectual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2210" id="Page_2210">Pg 2210</a></span>
attempts to escape, to surrender through famine, and pardoned
him and all his soldiers. He razed Perusia to the ground and

<p>The Parthians, who had joined the Pompeian party, under the
command of Labienus, invaded Syria, and having beaten Decidius
Saxa, a lieutenant-general under Antonius, seized that whole province.
When Marcus Antonius was excited to dispute with C&aelig;sar
by his wife Fulvia, having dismissed her, lest she should mar the
concord of the generals, and having concluded a treaty of peace
with C&aelig;sar, he married his sister Octavia. He himself informed
against Quintus Salvidienus, who was forming a villanous combination
against C&aelig;sar, who, having been condemned, committed
suicide. [<span class="smcap">y. r.</span> 713. <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 39.] Publius Ventidius, the lieutenant of
Antony, drove the Parthians from Syria, having conquered them in
battle, their general, Labienus, having been slain. When Sextus
Pompey held Sicily, (being hostilely disposed, and near to Italy,)
and obstructed the commerce in corn, at his own request C&aelig;sar and
Antony entered into a treaty of peace, so that he was made governor
of Sicily. This book contains also the history of the commotions

<p>Several battles were fought at sea, with Sextus Pompeius, with
various success; of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s two fleets, one under the command of
Agrippa gained a victory; the other, led by C&aelig;sar himself, was cut
off; and his soldiers, being sent on shore, were exposed to great
dangers. Pompeius, being afterwards defeated, fled into Sicily.
Marcus Lepidus, who came from Africa, under the pretext of joining
C&aelig;sar in the war which he was about to wage against Sextus
Pompeius, when he declared war against C&aelig;sar himself, being deserted
by his army, and deprived of the honour of the triumvirate,

with Cleopatra, having arrived late in Media, with eighteen
legions and sixteen thousand horse, made war upon the Parthians.
When, having lost two of his legions, nothing prospered with him,
he retreated to Armenia; being pursued by the Parthians, he fled
three hundred miles in twenty-one days, great trepidation and
danger encompassing his whole army. He lost about eight thousand
men by tempests; he was himself the cause, as well of the
losses by the tempests, as of the unfortunate Parthian war; for he

whom he had two sons, Alexander and Philadelphus, would neither
come to Rome, nor, the time of his triumvirate being expired, would
resign that office; but meditated war, which he should wage against
Rome and Italy, and for that purpose was preparing great forces
both by sea and land, having also divorced Octavia, C&aelig;sar&#8217;s sister.

snake of such enormous size, that it prevented the army of Atilius
Regulus from using the water: and that, after seizing many of the
soldiers in its powerful fangs, and crushing several to death in the
folds of its tail, as soon as they discovered that it could not be
injured by weapons cast by the hand, it was at last attacked on
every side by missiles from the engines, and killed by numerous
and ponderous blows of huge stones; and that it appeared to all,
both cohorts and legions, more terrible than Carthage itself. He
narrates that the Romans were compelled to remove their camp,
owing to the river being tinged with its blood, and the air in the
vicinity being corrupted by the pestilential effluvia.</p>

<p>It is recorded in Livy that when a certain general, who was
desirous of carrying on a war, was prevented by one of the tribunes of
the commons from setting out on the expedition, he ordered the
sacred chickens to be brought forward: when they did not eat the
corn that was cast before them, the consul, in derision of the augury,
said, &#8220;let them drink,&#8221; and cast them into the Tiber. Afterwards,
when returning victorious in his ships, he was drowned off the
coast of Africa, with all that he commanded.&mdash;Servius. Virg.

<p>And in repeating the attack with a small body of troops on the
walls of Alisfa, after coming like a marauder, an elephant covered
with armour broke forth from the town: the consul took it, and
after slaying those on its back, reserved it for the fight. But the
townsmen, as they felt little anxiety about it, on the second day,
armed with shields, engraven with the figures of elephants, attack
a few fugitives, and retake the elephant under more favourable

<p>The inhabitants of Contrebia, although they were attacked by the
pangs of famine, in addition to their other calamities, after making
many ineffectual attempts to repel the war from their city and
walls, injured the works of Sertorius by casting fire from the
walls; and a tower of many stories, which exceeded in height all
the fortifications of the city, being consumed by the spreading
flames, fell to the ground with a great crash. However, during the
following night another tower was reared in the same place, by the
efforts of Sertorius, who remained awake all night; the sight of
which at the dawn struck the enemy with astonishment. At the
same time the city-tower, which had been their strongest defence,
as its foundations were undermined, began to yawn with great
rents, and afterwards take fire from a torch that was thrown against
it; and the inhabitants of Contrebia, being terrified by the fear of
the fire and fall of the battlements combined, fled in alarm from
the walls: and the whole populace shouted out that ambassadors
should be sent to surrender the city. The same valour which had
urged Sertorius to besiege them when they provoked him, made
him, when victorious, more inclined to mercy. After receiving
hostages, he exacted a small sum of money, and took away from
them all their arms. He ordered the deserters that were freemen
to be brought alive to him: he ordered the inhabitants to slay the
fugitive slaves, of whom there was a greater number. They cut
their throats and cast them from the walls. Having reduced Contrebia,
after a siege of forty-four days, which cost him a great number
of men, and having left Lucius Insteius in command there with
a strong garrison, he himself marched his army to the river Iberus.
Then having built his winter quarters nigh to the town, which is
called Castra &AElig;lia, he remained in person in the camp; during the
day he held a congress of the allied states in the town. He had
previously issued a proclamation throughout the entire province,
that each state should make arms in proportion to its resources:
and after inspecting them, he ordered his soldiers to bring in their
other arms, which had been rendered ineffective by frequent
marches, or assaults and battles, and divided the new arms among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2216" id="Page_2216">Pg 2216</a></span>
the men by means of the centurions. He also furnished the cavalry
with new arms: and distributed among them clothes, which had
been previously prepared for them, and gave them pay also. He
searched carefully for mechanics, and brought them together from
every quarter, and erected public manufactories in which he could
employ their labour, and made calculations of the amount of work
that could be done each day. Therefore all the implements of war
were in process of preparation at the same time: neither did the
mechanics want materials, as all things had been previously prepared
by the zealous efforts of the states; nor was any department
of the service unprovided with proper workmen. Then, after
calling together the embassies of all the nations and states, he
returned them thanks, because they furnished the supplies which
had been levied on them for the infantry: he laid before them a
statement of the acts which he had performed in defending his
allies and besieging the cities of the enemy, and encouraged them
to prosecute the war with vigour: he informed them, briefly, how
deeply the provinces of Spain were interested in the success of his
party. He then dismissed the assembly, and after bidding them
all to be of good courage, and return to their respective states, he
sent Marcus Perperna early in spring with twenty thousand infantry
and fifteen hundred cavalry, to the nation of the Ilercaonians,
to defend the maritime coast of that country: he gave him
instructions relative to the routes by which he should march to
defend the cities in alliance with him, which Pompey was besieging,
and pointed out the places in which he might lay ambuscades for
Pompey on his march. At the same time he sent letters to Herennuleius,
who was in the same country, and to Lucius Hirtulius, in
the other province, with instructions as to the manner in which he
wished the war to be conducted: charging him especially &#8220;to
defend the allied states in such a manner as not to fight a pitched
battle with Metellus, for whom he was not a match either in influence
or strength. That he himself did not intend to march against
Pompey; nor did he believe that the latter would come to a pitched
battle; since if the war were protracted, the enemy could procure
supplies from every quarter by their shipping, as they had the sea
at their back, and all the provinces under their dominion; and that
he himself would be reduced to want of every thing, since what he
had previously stored was consumed during the former summer.
That Perperna was appointed to the command of the region bordering
on the sea, in order that he might be able to defend the
country which was as yet free from the ravages of the enemy, and
at the same time attack them unawares, if any opportunity should
occur.&#8221; He determined to march in person with his army against
the Beronians and Autrigonians; because he ascertained that they
had frequently, during the winter, solicited aid from Pompey, and
had sent persons to point out the way to the Roman army, during
the time that he himself was employed in besieging the Celtiberian
cities; and besides, his soldiers were often harassed by their cavalry
during the siege of Contrebia, in whatsoever direction they might
proceed in search of corn and forage. They had even the hardihood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2217" id="Page_2217">Pg 2217</a></span>
at that time to solicit the Arevaci to join their party. He
intended, after giving them an example of the severity of war, to
deliberate which of his two enemies he should attack, which of the
two provinces he should repair to: whether he should go to the
maritime coast, to prevent Pompey from entering Ilercaonia and
Contestania, both of which were allied nations, or should turn his
attention to Metellus and Lusitania. Sertorius, anxiously deliberating
on these plans, marched his army peaceably along the banks
of the river Iberus, through the territory of his allies, without injuring
any one. Then he marched into the territories of the Bursaonians,
Cascantinians, and Gracchuritanians; and after wasting
every thing, and trampling down the crops, came to Calaguris
Nasica, a city of the allies; and after passing the river nigh to the
town, by a bridge built for the occasion, he encamped there. On
the next day he sent Marcus Marius, the qu&aelig;stor, into the territory
of the Arevacans and Cerindonians, to enlist soldiers among those
nations, and to convey the corn from them to Contrebia, called also
Leucas, near which city lay the most convenient roads leading out
of the country of the Beronians, in whatever direction he should
determine to march his army: and he sent Caius Insteius, the prefect
of the cavalry, to Liguria and the nation of the Vacc&aelig;ans, to search
for horsemen, with orders to wait for him at Contrebia with such
cavalry as he could collect. After despatching them, he himself
set out, and having marched his army through the territory of the
Vasconians, pitched his camp on the confines of the Beronians. On
the next day he went forward with the cavalry to reconnoitre the
roads, after giving orders to the infantry to march in the form of a
square, and came to Vacc&aelig;a, the strongest city in that country.
He came on them unexpectedly during the night. The townsmen
having summoned from every quarter the cavalry, both of their
own nation and the Autrigonians, made a sally and marched
against Sertorius, to prevent him from entering the pass.&mdash;The

when the Romans, after storming the town, were butchering those

engaged in the sacred ceremonies continued to offer divine worship
with the same attention, and were not induced, either by the fear

around them, to take to flight, for they considered it better to suffer

of his being rescued from Antonius, than of Brutus and Cassius being
saved from C&aelig;sar, and so the matter really was. He fled first to the
territory of Tusculum, and afterwards proceeded by crossroads into
the territory of Formi&aelig;, with the intention of embarking at Caieta.
From which he sailed out several times into the deep sea, but when
the adverse winds at one time drove him back, at another he himself
could not endure the pitching of the ship in the heavy roll of
the sea, he was at length seized with a disgust at both life and
flight: and having returned to his upper villa, which is little more
than a mile from the sea, he said, &#8220;I will die in my native land
that I have saved so often.&#8221; It is ascertained that his slaves were
prepared to fight with bravery and fidelity; and that he himself
ordered them to lay down the litter, and bear with resignation
whatever the severity of fortune would enjoin. As he stretched
forth from the litter, and held his neck unmoved, his head was cut
off. Nor did that suffice the senseless cruelty of the soldiers. They
cut off his hands also, in reproach of their having written any thing
against Antonius. In this way his head was brought to Antonius,
and by his orders placed between his hands on the rostrum. The
people, raising up their eyes bedimmed with tears, could scarcely
bear the sight of his dismembered limbs. He lived sixty-three years;
so that in the absence of violence his death would not have seemed a
premature one: his genius was successfully displayed in his works,
and in gaining the rewards of his works: he himself was for a long
time prosperous, yet during his long career of success suffering occasionally
great calamities: namely, exile, the ruin of the party which
he had espoused, the death of his daughter, his own, so miserable
and galling; none of which calamities he bore with the firmness
worthy of a man, except his death, which, to a man that estimated
matters justly, might seem less likely to call forth indignation, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2221" id="Page_2221">Pg 2221</a></span>
had not suffered from his victorious enemy greater cruelty than he
would himself have practised, if he had been equally successful.
However, if any one will weigh accurately his virtues against his
vices, he will come to the conclusion that he was a great, energetic,
and remarkable man, and one who would require the eulogies of a

<p>Since traces of the dissensions between Augustus and Antonius
still existed, Cocceius Nerva, the ancestor of that Nerva who was
subsequently emperor of Rome, recommended to Augustus to send
deputies to treat of affairs in general. Therefore M&aelig;cenas and
Agrippa were sent, who brought both armies into one camp, as Livy
relates in the 127th book. But we must understand that when Fonteius
was deputed by Antonius, Augustus sent M&aelig;cenas and others
to the same place.&mdash;Acro on Horace. When a dispute arose between
C&aelig;sar Augustus and Antonius, Cocceius Nerva, the ancestor of him
who was afterwards emperor of Rome, requested of C&aelig;sar to send
some one to Tarracina to negotiate the principal points. M&aelig;cenas
held the conference first, and was shortly after joined by Agrippa,
and there entered into a most solemn compact with Antonius&#8217;s
deputies, and ordered the standards of both armies to be brought
together into the same camp. Livy mentions this also in the 127th
book, but makes no mention of Capito.&mdash;Porphyrio on Horace.
Fonteius Capito had been sent as deputy by Antonius and M&aelig;cenas,
and Agrippa, in a similar capacity, by Augustus, owing to the mediation
of Cocceius Nerva, who possessed great influence with both
Augustus and Antonius, and was the ancestor of the emperor Nerva.
But the deputies met for the purpose of negotiating the general interests
of their principals, and settling the disputes that had broken
out between these two commanders; which they did, and brought

Livy, that countless thousands of men perished very frequently in
this city by the breaking out of plagues, and that matters often
came to such a state that there were scarcely sufficient men to constitute
an army in those warlike times, were no sacrifices offered to
your god, Februarius, at that period? Or was his worship utterly
ineffectual? Were not the Lupercalia celebrated at that time? For
you cannot say that these sacred rites were unknown at the time
since they were said to have been introduced into Italy by Evander
before the date of Romulus. But Livy, in his second decade, tells us
the reason of the institution of the Lupercalia (as they are intimately
connected with his own superstitions): he does not say that they
were instituted to check disease, but to remove the barrenness of
women, which was then prevalent.&mdash;Gelasius.</p>

<p>According to Livy, ambassadors suing for peace are called
heralds.&mdash;Servius.</p>

<p>Livy calls silver heavy; he means masses of it.&mdash;Servius.</p>

<p>On this eminence (the promontory of Circ&aelig;um) was a town, which
was called both Circ&aelig;um and Circ&aelig;i. For Livy uses both.&mdash;Servius.</p>

<p>Titus Livius was so unfavourable to Sallust, that he reproached
him with this sentence, &#8220;prosperity has a wonderful tendency to
cloak misconduct,&#8221; as being not only translated, but even spoiled in
the translation. Nor does he do this out of regard to Thucydides,
with a view to extol him. He praises him whose rivalry he does not
fear, and thinks that Sallust could be more easily surpassed by him
if he were previously excelled by Thucydides.&mdash;Seneca.</p>

<p>Titus Livy used to say that Miltiades, the rhetorician, made the
following elegant remark&mdash;&#8220;they are mad on common-place subjects ...&#8221;
in reference to orators who hunt after antiquated or
obsolete terms, and consider chastity of style to consist in obscurity
of diction.&mdash;Seneca.</p>

<p>Several have fallen into the same error: nor is it a novel defect,
since I find, even in Livy, that there was a certain teacher of
rhetoric who ordered his pupils to throw an air of mystery over
their expressions, which he expressed by the Greek word [Greek: skotison].
From which circumstance originated the remarkable expression of
approbation: &#8220;so much the better: even I myself did not understand.&#8221;&mdash;Quintilian.</p>

<p>Therefore that hint was the safest, of which an example occurs
in Livy, in the letter written to his son, &#8220;we ought to read Demosthenes
and Cicero, and them too in such a manner that each of us
should closely resemble Demosthenes and Cicero.&#8221;&mdash;Quintilian.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">5</span></a> The difficulty, which Scheffer, Crevier, and Drakenborch apparently
had, in interpreting this passage with the reading (decem cubita), seems
to me to have arisen principally from their misinterpretation of the word
cuspis; which in the classics is no where used as the edge of a cutting,
but the point of a piercing instrument&mdash;differt a mucrone, qu&aelig; est acies
gladii.&mdash;Facciolati. That the cuspides, here spoken of, must have been
piercing, not cutting instruments, is likewise proved from the meaning of
the word &#8220;transfigerent,&#8221; which is never used in reference to a cutting
instrument. Taking it for granted, then, that the &#8220;cuspitibus decem
cubita&#8221; were spears ten feet long, fastened to the pole and extended from
the yoke, I can easily understand how they, being so long, were likely to
clear the way far in front of the horses, while the &#8220;falces&#8221; on either
side were intended to cut down those that escaped the cuspides; and
this being the case, I see no necessity for Scheffer&#8217;s reading, &#8220;cubito,&#8221;
which Crevier also seems to favour, and Drakenborch&#8217;s &#8220;duo&#8221; for
&#8220;decem;&#8221; both of which seem to have been adopted, owing to the
seeming improbability of cutting weapons so long, and proportionably
heavy, being attached to the poles of chariots.</p></div>
